I could hear the echo through the city.
[distant engines revving]
It's like this scream.
[F1 engine screeching]
[Christian Horner] When they
get into a 200-mile-an-hour car...
[engine roaring]
...there's an almost
fighter pilot mentality.
[Horner] Anything can happen.
[Carlos Sainz]
I always think of my family.
[Grace Ricciardo]
All I do is pray for a safe race.
[Romain Grosjean]
You need to respect the speed.
But the second a driver has fear,
you need to retire.
[Damon Hill]
Formula One is the ultimate competition.
-Uncontrolled drama.
-[man yelling]
-[David Croft] Oh, there's a puncture!
-Oh!
[Horner] Competitiveness,
high stakes, politics...
How can you call that a fair championship?
[Daniel] It is described
as a traveling circus.
[cheering]
[man] We pack it all up,
and 24 hours later,
unpack it in a new part of the world.
[Zak Brown] We've all got
thousands of employees...
that all share the desire to win.
[engine revving]
[cheering]
[man] The drivers
are the best in the world.
[Sainz] We all believe we are the one.
[Kevin Magnussen] Your teammate
is your worst enemy.
[Daniel] If he beats me every race,
my career's done.
The ultimate goal is to be the best.
[reporter] If you had Lewis Hamilton's
same car, would you beat him?
Yes.
[Guenther Steiner]
The highs are very high.
Whoo-hoo!
[man in Italian]
Thank you, thank you so much.
[Steiner] The lows are very low.
I'm fucking sick of this.
[Daniel] It's about making
the correct choices.
[Natalie Pinkham] Every day I break out
in a cold sweat, thinking,
"Do I have the skill set to do it?"
[Sainz] The risk of death
will never go away.
[Croft] Massive accident!
-[Magnussen] I'm not worried about dying.
-Whoa.
[Magnussen] I'm willing to do anything.
[Daniel] Let's see who's the best.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[Daniel] All right,
am I good to, like, sit?
[interviewer] Yeah.
-[Daniel] All right. I'm good to go.
-[interviewer] Okay.
[woman] Are you happy with your hair?
I don't know. I haven't seen it.
Prob-- If you've asked me,
then it must look shit.
[woman] No, no, no. I'm just...
[Daniel] Am I looking at you
or down the lens?
-[interviewer] At me, sorry.
-[Daniel] Awesome.
Can I get you to tell me who you are
and what you do for a job?
I'm Daniel Ricciardo
and I'm a car mechanic.
[interviewer laughing]
All righty, I got this. I'm gonna nail it.
Three, two, one... I am Daniel Ricciardo.
I was born in Perth, Australia,
and I'm a Formula One driver.
Sounds pretty good when I say that.
[engine roaring]
[Daniel] I love that feeling of the car
on the edge at such a high speed.
I love the danger.
That adrenaline and that excitement.
[tires squealing]
More than anything,
I love the feeling of winning.
It's a beautiful thing.
[Croft]
And Ricciardo has got the inside line.
Lewis Hamilton's brave defense
of second place comes to an end.
[Croft] And down the inside
goes Daniel Ricciardo!
Oh, my God.
[Daniel on radio]
That's how it's done, ladies.
Whoo hoo!
[Croft] And Daniel Ricciardo wins
the Hungarian Grand Prix.
[crowd cheering]
[Croft] I don't think anyone's smile
could be bigger.
[Daniel] As a kid, I loved motorbikes.
I loved NASCAR.
Oh, shit!
But F1, that was
the fastest circuit cars in the world.
That's really why I got into Formula One.
I wanted to try and see if I could be
the best in the world.
Picturing myself on the top step
of an F1 podium,
I had visualized that feeling as a kid.
To be world champion would mean
the world to me.
Look at this geek here standing beside me.
For my family,
my dream involved sacrifices.
[announcer] Great start
from Daniel Ricciardo...
[Daniel]
My dad was building his own business,
but also taking me karting
on the weekends
and spending the money he'd made
to then put into me.
Don't forget his helmet.
There you go.
I remember as if it was yesterday.
Daniel said to me that he'd wanted
to give it a go in Europe.
Put it on Uncle Daniel.
[Grace] And a lot of friends said,
"Oh, how could you let him go?"
But he was so determined.
That looks great.
How do you do it?
What am I doing wrong here?
[man] Rip it off, man.
[Daniel] All the struggles,
all the bad days...
leaving home so young.
-[Grace] Have the rest?
-Yeah.
[Daniel] Winning the world title,
it would make it all worth it.
[Daniel] Baa!
When I got into F1,
everyone knew me as the happy guy
and the nice guy,
but I do have a kind of killer instinct.
I do believe I can be world champion
and for me, it's like,
"Why else would I be doing this?"
[Croft] And welcome along
for the opening round
of the Formula One World Championship
in 2018.
Welcome to the 23rd
Australian Grand Prix
held here in Albert Park for
the traditional first race of the season.
No Australian has been classified
in the top three of their home race.
[announcer] Daniel Ricciardo,
ladies and gentlemen.
[crowd cheering]
[Croft] Is this the year?
[Daniel] First race of the season
is my home one.
[woman 1] Daniel!
[Daniel] I love having a home race.
But it's wild, you know?
[woman 2] Can I get a photo?
[Daniel] There's so much anticipation
being drawn to that first race in March.
Can we get a quick selfie, mate?
-Yeah, of course.
-Cheers, man.
And then, 'cause it's in Australia...
[man] We're all cheering for you.
[laughing]
[Daniel] I'm the only Australian driver.
I get that two-fold.
-[man] Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!
-[woman] Oy, oy, oy!
-[man] Let's go, Dan!
-[woman] Yay!
[cameras clicking]
How important is this season for you
as being a season in which
you can compete for the championship?
It's super important.
This will see where I am personally,
see where we are competitively...
Everybody recognizes
Daniel Ricciardo
as being one of the biggest talents
in Formula One.
But a lot of people think
it's this year or bust
for him to take his first world title.
I think it's gonna be
a really exciting year
because we've got three teams
that look capable of winning races.
Last season, Lewis Hamilton with Mercedes
and Sebastian Vettel at Ferrari
were the top two.
This season, we're really excited to see
if Daniel Ricciardo with Red Bull
can properly fight with those two drivers.
It's easy to say that a champion
from a previous year is the favorite.
But Red Bull are gonna be
very hard to beat.
-[reporter] How does it look for you?
-It's looking exciting.
I think it should be close at the top
with Mercedes, uh, Ferrari, Red Bull.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[Medland] In Formula One,
we've got 10 teams,
and each team is trying to develop
the best car possible.
[tools whirring]
The more money you spend,
the better your car is likely to be.
But there's a massive difference
in budgets in Formula One.
The smaller teams are quite often
operating on a budget
that's a fraction
of the size of the very biggest teams,
like Ferrari and Mercedes.
So, it's not a level playing field.
Guys, I mean, you know the position
we are in here, you know?
If I understood what Walter
told me last night,
there was one of everything.
I'm Guenther Steiner. I am the team
principal of Haas F1 team.
I love racing, it's my passion.
I started off from the bottom
as a mechanic.
I am doing it a long time,
more than 30 years.
Oh, yeah, and he should be.
Setting up a Formula One team
in the US was my idea,
and I persuaded Gene Haas to do this.
I think at turn one, he had no choice.
He had-- Everybody was going, whatever.
[Steiner] Gene has got
a very successful NASCAR team,
and he knows how racing works.
-Seventy-one.
-Did he hit somebody?
Yeah, Yeah. He, hit...
because he...
[drill whirring]
[Hass] There's a lot of money
in Formula One.
Can you compete with the teams
with the big budgets? It's pretty hard.
You know, you're talking
five, six hundred million
to our 140 million.
But, you just gotta keep
trying and trying
and a lot of success in racing
comes down to just being stubborn.
[Steiner] Haas F1 is the first American
Formula One team in more than 30 years
and coming in as a new team in Formula One
is just so difficult.
I'm not convinced, but
I'm cautiously optimistic, as I call it.
In a small team,
we have less parts, less stuff.
We need to do more with less.
And how many people in your team,
all together?
Two hundred twelve.
[chuckles]
[Brundle] Mercedes have more people
on holiday at any one time.
[Steiner] Oh, yeah, yeah.
We are the underdogs.
We are new in here.
But, for sure, we're not here just
to make the numbers up.
We are here to compete.
[Croft] It's the first Friday practice.
Teams have 90 minutes to test their setups
around this three-mile circuit.
[engine roaring]
[Medland] One of the most special things
about Formula One
is the way the weekend builds.
Friday is practice.
That's when the teams and drivers get out
on track to try and set their cars up
and make sure
it's performing the best it can.
Saturday, there's qualifying,
to set the order that the cars
will start the race in.
And then on Sunday,
we have the race itself.
Every session is dangerous.
Last season at Melbourne,
during practice, there were three crashes.
[tires squealing]
[air hissing]
[Horner] You all right?
Are you happy
with the strategy we are taking?
Yeah, fine.
The problem is that at some point,
one's gonna be right,
one's gonna be wrong.
-You never know.
-Yeah, yeah, exactly.
My name's Christian Horner.
I'm the team principal
of Aston Martin Red Bull racing.
So, uh, buck effectively stops with me.
[Croft] Sebastian Vettel,
you are the world champion!
[cheering]
[Horner] We're a subsidiary
of an energy drink
that's come along and won four
back-to-back world championships.
[cheering]
[Horner] But that's in the past.
What do you reckon?
You know, we've spent five seasons now
where we should have been real contenders.
We need to win races this year.
We need to take the challenge
to the big teams.
[Horner] You all right?
Get out there and enjoy it.
-[Daniel] I will, thank you.
-[Horner] Yeah?
Let your driving do the talking.
You'll be fine.
[Horner] Every team has two drivers.
We're fortunate to have Daniel Ricciardo.
He's at the top of his game.
Well, you can see the people who are...
[Horner] And we've got this exciting,
emerging talent in Max Verstappen.
But you can just feel
that anticipation of,
"Have we designed a good car this year?
Is it gonna be successful?
Is it gonna be reliable?"
Okay, well let's see how we go.
I think it looks okay. I suggest we go
and have little up and down.
[Daniel] Okay.
Let's go, please.
[Daniel] As a racecar driver,
your feeling is so in tune,
that you know, after a few laps,
if the car is fast.
A lot of it, for me,
is confidence within the car
and just having a feeling
under the braking.
'Cause your coming up to a corner,
300 and something kilometers an hour.
Your instinct is like,
"Brake now, brake now, brake now,"
and you've gotta push yourself
to brake later and later
and trust that the car will stop.
[Paul di Resta]
He's got confidence in that car.
He is ripping the wheels off that.
[Daniel] Whoo!
[Croft] What's your headline
for today then?
[di Resta] Red Bull , they could easily
find themselves in the front of the grid.
[Simon Rennie]
You're doing a good job.
[Daniel] Thanks, guys.
[Daniel] We had serious pace today.
The car was performing well.
And at the end of the day,
performance is everything.
I wanna win, because it's
what I believe I can do
and I've worked all these years to do it.
So, no one's gonna put more pressure
on me than myself.
[Brundle]
So, who can set the fastest lap today
and start tomorrow's race
on pole position?
[Medland] In qualifying, it's all designed
to set the order
for the start of the race.
[Croft] Here's the time
that they've all got to beat.
Lewis Hamilton crosses the line.
It's a 1:21.1!
[Medland] If you start in a good position,
you have a much better chance
of winning the race.
Qualifying is the moment that you see
these cars on the absolute limit.
And the driver pushing it to boundaries
that you don't even know quite
where the edge is.
[tires squealing]
-[Brundle] My God. That's, uh, Bottas!
-[Croft] That's Valtteri Bottas!
That's Bottas wrecking his qualifying,
wrecking his car.
[Brundle]
It's not gonna polish out, is it?
Guys, I just wanted to speak with you
a few minutes
before we need to go out on the track
and see what we can do. So...
From Gene's and my side, we are confident
that we can do better than last year.
I think on the pit stops, we have got
a few new people and it will be,
I wouldn't say difficult, but we need to
get used to new people in the pit-stops,
so, I think we can do it.
Thank you very much, guys.
How many minutes?
He said it should be really three minutes.
He's warming up the carbon fiber.
My name is Kevin Magnussen.
I am 26 years old
and I drive for Haas F1 team.
Qualifying is really intense.
There is a lot of pressure in Formula One
to deliver results and to perform well.
And that's the hardest thing about it.
[Croft] We're on-board now
with Kevin Magnussen
underneath the bridge as we go,
and they touch!
And that could have been
very nasty indeed!
[Magnussen]
I don't have fear when I drive.
I don't ever think about
the consequences of crashing the car.
I'm not worried about dying.
I'll do anything I can
to get the best results possible.
[Giuliano Salvi] Okay, watch
the traffic light and the white line.
-Did you copy?
-[Magnussen] Okay.
[Magnussen] To drive a lap fast
is all rhythm and feeling.
You feel just like one with the car,
as if it was your body.
For me it feels like flying.
It's almost like having superpowers.
[announcer] Here comes Magnussen.
And he's absolutely
nailed sectors one and two.
What's his time going to be?
A 1:23.1,
and that's a sensational lap from Haas.
Well done, son.
He fucking did it. Jesus!
[laughs]
Whoa.
[laughs]
[Croft] What a performance from Haas.
They'll be fifth and sixth
in tomorrow's race,
the highest they've ever started
in a Grand Prix.
Great job. I'm really proud of you.
[Magnussen laughs]
[Magnussen] Well done, guys.
Fucking hell. Well done.
Well done, man!
Happy. [laughs]
[In Italian] In the mountains!
-Thank you.
-[laughs]
Hi, Gene. That wasn't bad, though.
[chuckles]
Fuck. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, with the big boys, yeah?
Pretty cool, we start fifth.
Fifth and sixth.
[Steiner] When we started,
everybody told us we will fail.
But Gene supported me all the way
and has put a lot of faith in me
and failing in doing this
is not an option.
We need to succeed.
[Croft] Twenty drivers, 21 races.
There can only be one world champion.
Welcome along to the Formula One
World Championship.
[dramatic music playing]
[man] Dan!
[Daniel] I love race day.
That feeling of having
the fans, you know, right there.
[cell phone ringing]
-It's ringing.
-[boy] Ah...
Um... Hi, Chris, how're you going?
[boy 1] This is Daniel Ricciardo, Chris.
[boy 2] That's my dad, Dan!
[cheering]
[Daniel] Hometown kid,
so a lot of fans, a lot of support
and let's try and give them
something to cheer about.
-How are you?
-How are you, buddy?
-Good. You just got in? Awesome.
-Good.
-Yeah, thank you.
-Awesome. See you.
Wow. Wow.
I know.
[commentator]
This is how the grid will line up.
The reigning champion,
Lewis Hamilton, on pole.
Kimi Raikkonen in second,
out-qualifying his four-time
world champion teammate, Sebastian Vettel.
Max Verstappen starts fourth,
Kevin Magnussen is fifth,
giving Haas their best ever start.
Daniel Ricciardo is in eighth,
after receiving a penalty in practice.
So, he'll face a huge challenge
to get a podium today.
[indistinct chatter]
[Steiner] When the race starts,
it's a great moment.
To be actually in charge
of one of the teams out there,
that is what I dreamt for
when I was a kid.
[Magnussen] The atmosphere is tense.
And you can feel
your body is ready to perform.
[Daniel] If someone says
they don't get nervous, they're lying.
The nerves for me is that anticipation
of what we're about to do.
[Horner] Immediately before a race,
I block out all of the other distractions.
I'm very conscious that,
when I look into the driver’s eyes,
the risk that he's taking on.
You have a car going in excess
of 200 miles an hour,
racing wheel-to-wheel.
These guys have
an almost fighter pilot mentality.
And that's what separates them
from mere mortals.
[Grace] I remember, when he was little,
going to Melbourne,
we had grandstand tickets
right opposite the pits.
All the drivers are there
and I'm thinking,
"That's somebody's child."
And I was thinking for these poor mothers.
And then I ended up being one of them.
I never, ever, ever thought that
I'd be there one day, watching my son.
[Daniel] Radio, check, check, check,
check, check, check, check, check, check.
[Rennie] Okay, so the latest info...
wind is stronger today.
So, you've got a head-wind into turn one.
[Daniel] Okay.
[Daniel]
You've got hundreds of people on the grid.
And then you've got a 30-second warning.
[man] Thirty seconds. Thirty seconds.
[Daniel] And then, all the mechanics go.
The grid is then empty
and it's just you and the other drivers.
[Magnussen] Rushing into the first corner,
it's all instinctive.
[Croft] Great start
from Kevin Magnussen.
He's managed to get past Max Verstappen.
Come on, Max, straighten.
We haven't got time for this.
[Croft] Daniel Ricciardo down the inside.
He's made up a place.
[Grace] Emotionally,
we're sort of always up and down.
All I ever do is pray for a safe race.
And then everything else is a bonus.
It's the biggest thing
that we're always worried about.
Number one thing,
don't even like talking about it now.
You know, it makes me nervous.
[Horner] It's hugely intense.
You're looking an awful lot at numbers,
at split times,
at the sawtooth graphs.
[Croft] Ricciardo's on a charge,
on the outside of Nico Hulkenberg.
Nice job, mate.
[Croft] Hulkenberg fights back.
He's got the inside line
but Ricciardo sweeps on by.
[Horner] It's mentally draining
if you're dealing with two cars,
two different outcomes.
[Verstappen] These tires
are getting really hot.
Max, recommend saving your overtake
for the one place you feel
Magnussen is most vulnerable.
[tires screeching]
[Croft] And he's gone off!
No! Fuck, no!
Verstappen just spun.
[Croft] Grosjean goes past,
Ricciardo goes past.
[Verstappen] Oh, for fucks sake, man!
[man] All okay, Max?
Yeah.
[Croft] This is dreamland for Haas.
So, there's
now only Mercedes and Ferraris
in front of the young American Haas team.
[Steiner] This is racing.
It's realizing it's a big opportunity
to ram home what you're doing.
[Croft] We've got a massive lock up.
That's Magnussen.
[Magnussen]
Tires are starting to go, guys.
It's starting to understeer
more and more now
[Salvi] Okay. Box, Kevin.
Box, please confirm.
Box, box, box.
[Magnussen] In the pit stops,
that is the only time
that you really get
in touch with the team.
You're on your own on the track.
Everything is depending on you.
When you pit, that changes completely.
That's when you realize
how much of a team effort it is.
[tools whirring]
[engine roaring]
[Croft] Kevin Magnussen has pitted.
-I don't think that's tight.
-Which one? Which one?
Left rear. I don't do any other one.
Are you sure it's not tight?
[Magnussen] Failure, guys.
[Croft] And who's that going slowly?
It's Kevin Magnussen!
Kevin Magnussen in the Haas,
he's just come out of the pit lane
and now he's grinding to a halt.
[Salvi] Stop the car. Stop the car.
Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car.
[Croft] Magnussen was on
for a sensational result,
but now he's retiring.
[inaudible]
[Magnussen] It's heartbreaking.
You don't want it to be true.
[Croft] And by the looks of things,
one of those wheels
isn't attached properly.
[Steiner] You just cope with it.
They've got two drivers.
You just try to stay as calm
as possible and focus on the race.
[man] Box now, Romain. Box now.
[tools whirring]
[Croft] Romain Grosjean has now pitted
and makes his way back onto the circuit.
So Ricciardo now has clear air.
That's good news for the Red Bull team.
As Grosjean--
Is that Grosjean going slowly? It is!
[man] Stop the car. Stop the car.
We have a front left loose.
Stop the car. Stop the car.
[Croft] Romain Grosjean pulling over
in the other Haas.
So both Haases,
as soon as they leave the pit lane,
have ground to a halt.
Unbelievable.
[Brundle] What could have been
one of their best weekends on a race track
has turned into absolute disaster.
[Steiner]
When you see it happen on the screen,
you think, "This cannot happen.
This is not real."
We lost it all in two laps.
In Formula One,
the highs are very high,
the lows are very low.
It's easy in my position
to blame somebody,
but then in the end,
the buck stops with me.
You've got a horde of media out here.
Are you happy to speak to people?
[Steiner] Oh, yeah, yeah.
They need to hear. That's fine. Yeah.
[reporter] It's a sad afternoon.
We've seen all your people.
They're heartbroken,
as well as the drivers.
How is it to be a boss
in a moment like that?
I mean, in the end
as a boss, you need to lead.
I am sure my disappointment
is as big as theirs.
We need first to see what went wrong
before we can fix it.
[Magnussen] I just need a bit of a break
[reporter] Otherwise, you'll say
something afterwards?
-[Magnussen] I don't know.
-Okay, thanks.
[Magnussen] We were
in fourth and fifth position.
-Just help me with those guys
-Yeah. Yeah.
[Magnussen]
And that would've been, by far,
the best result for the team
in its history.
I don't know, Gene. I don't have to answer
to that one. We just fucked this one up.
Doesn't make it right.
I know that, you know.
Saying I fucked it up,
it doesn't make it right. It's like...
Same mistake. It's unbelievable.
The two guys putting the wheel on,
they were new.
Fuck! Fourth and fifth, but, Gene,
if we finish fourth and fifth here,
we fucking look like rock stars, huh?
And now we're a fucking bunch of wankers.
Yeah, a bunch of fucking clowns here.
I will do a proper investigation, Gene.
Don't worry, you know that.
I will fix it, trust me.
The wheel just wasn't done enough, huh?
It felt tight, but as it dropped
it visually looked as though
it was loose.
Not done up properly, sir.
You, did you think we train not enough?
Or...
We haven't practiced
this weekend at all. Um...
Tiredness as well...
I don't think that will help.
Just on the back foot this weekend.
[Steiner] But the wheels were
not completely on, you know?
I'm devastated and I am truly sorry, sir.
[Croft] Raikkonen running
in third position.
Fourth for Daniel Ricciardo.
He's fought his way back
from eighth place.
If he can get on the podium today,
it would mean so, so much
for Daniel Ricciardo.
[Rennie] Hey, that is blistering pace.
[Daniel] I don't wanna let him breathe.
Doing the right thing.
Just keep the pressure on.
[Daniel] Understood.
[Croft] No Australian has been classified
in the top three of their home race.
He will be doing his damnedest
on this final lap.
[Rennie] You might as well
use the battery.
[Daniel] Understood.
[Brundle] Sebastian Vettel
wins the Grand Prix.
[Vettel] Whoo!
Hamilton second.
Third across the line...
it's just Kimi Raikkonen,
with Daniel Ricciardo in fourth.
[man] Oh!
Half a second, isn't it?
Right on, mate.
Fuck.
That was a very good job today, mate.
You did get the quickest lap of the race.
[Daniel] Yeah, I tried.
[cheering]
[Daniel] We had serious pace today.
We had a real chance at the podium,
and I'd wanted it so bad.
I really believe that I should be
winning more frequently.
I believe I've got the talent
and I put in the work.
So, it's not anger,
but it's frustration that comes through.
[announcer] And the winner, from Germany,
Sebastian Vettel.
Thanks, Pop.
I'm happy, but I'm pissed.
Probably like you.
Yeah.
Happy, but fuck.
I nearly threw something at the TV.
Yeah. Food delivery.
[Daniel] Anyway, I tried.
[Joe] Yeah, I know you did.
I know you did.
[Grace] No, yeah! It was good.
Good result.
You got the crowd excited.
-Yeah, I tried.
-They were cheering you on.
I tried.
I mean, the pace, when you dropped back
and you banked in at 25.
Even I didn't think we were that quick...
[Horner] It's a long season.
You know,
these cars develop so quickly.
You'll know where you'll be starting,
but you don't know
where you will be finishing.
Things change.
[Magnussen] I'd love to be
winning tomorrow, if I could.
That's my ultimate dream.
I'm pretty far from that at the moment.
I know that things like that
don't happen overnight.
I'm in a great team that I can grow
and prepare myself,
and hopefully one day
I can get a chance
to fight for a championship.
[Steiner] We should have done better.
Everybody in Haas wants to do better,
but so does everybody else.
Why you watch Formula One?
You want to see action.
You want to see drama.
You want to see
the underdog making a good result.
A story. Each race should have a story,
and the story should not be
all the time Mercedes or Ferrari wins,
because that story
gets old pretty quickly.
[engine roars]
[Daniel] My teammate, Max,
is becoming more of a threat.
He's one of the most exciting talents
in Formula One.
[Verstappen] I need to be
the faster driver of the two.
[Horner] There's no more brutal lesson
than what he's just had.
[Sainz] Fernando Alonso
is my racing hero.
[man] Okay, Carlos. Alonso behind you.
[Brundle] The stakes
have never been higher for McLaren.
I said, "This guy is not beating me.
No fucking way."[Sainz] That's important.
[Poole] So, we get
the central nervous system firing
in sort of a race intensity.
It's really high intensity.
And then the lateral band walk,
we'll do that twice through.
And then we'll go get in the sauna
and shower.
No cameras in this room, though.
[Poole laughs]
You don't want to see
what happens in there.
[Poole in Spanish] Let's go!
[Sainz] I think motorsport has been
in my blood since I was a kid.
-[grunting]
-[Poole] Power. Up. Power.
[Sainz] I was actually two years old
when I was given my first go-kart.
[Poole] Power, power, power, power!
Run! Run! Come on. Push, push, push.
My name is Carlos Sainz,
I drive for Renault Sport Formula One.
[Poole] Faster feet. Come on.
Faster, faster, faster...
[Sainz] Born in Madrid, Spain.
[Poole] Smash it against the wall.
Come on.
When I was nine years old,
I remember seeing Fernando Alonso
winning the World Championship.
[cheering]
[Sainz] In 2005, I meet Fernando Alonso
in the Spanish Grand Prix.
I remember going back home
and saying to my dad,
"I want to be like Fernando Alonso.
I want to be a Formula One driver."
I hope one day I can add my name
to the list of Spanish drivers
that have won a Formula One race.
[reporter] Fernando, who will win in
the championship between you and Carlos?
I think, uh, this is difficult to predict,
but, you know,
it depends of our teams a little bit.
But, um, if I have to bet my money,
I will put on McLaren and myself.
[Croft] What's happening to Carlos Sainz
in his battle with Fernando Alonso?
[motor downshifting]
[Croft] Sainz has taken
the long way around, onto the gravel.
That's never gonna win out
that particular Spanish duel.
Fernando Alonso is on his way home now!
Fifth place in this race
and what a performance that is!
I think it was definitely a good race,
and we should be proud of that,
but yeah,
I think there is a lot more to come.
[Croft] Carlos Sainz now
puts Fernando Alonso under pressure...
Is he gonna try and launch one?
He is, down the inside!
Alonso saw him coming.
And there's Carlos Sainz.
But Fernando Alonso got the inside line
and just cuts him off.
[Sainz] Fernando Alonso is my racing hero,
but I really wanna beat him,
because I've been losing against him.
I really want payback.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[birds chirping]
[Zak Brown] My view of McLaren
has always been
that they are the best racing team
in the world.
When I got the call to work here,
it was extremely, uh, special.
My name is Zak Brown.
I'm executive director
of McLaren Technology Group.
I've been in motor racing my entire life.
I'm now 46 years old.
We have a lot to offer at McLaren.
We've been absolutely dominant
over the years.
[Murray Walker] And McLaren
have already broken
just about every record in the book.
[Brown] To show up every day
and look down the boulevard,
and have the first thing you see
is Niki Lauda's car.
[crowd cheering]
[Brown] And Ayrton Senna's car.
[Walker] Ayrton Senna crosses the line.
He is world champion.
[Brown] We've got thousands of employees
running around here
that all share
the same passion and desire to win.
We've got a massive fan base,
but it's been pretty hard to cheer for us
'cause we've not been anywhere near
racing at the front.
You know, it's been
a difficult five-year run.
-Yeah, take that. Okay.
-Get rid of this...
'cause you're kind of shifting.
This is all drivers.
[Brown] I felt I could contribute
to making a difference.
We do everything in dollars.
If you're happy for me to flip them
all to dollars...
-put that down on the last page.
-Flip 'em. Flip 'em all to dollars.
-Okay.
-Otherwise it starts becoming a bit...
And so, I wanted
to get into an environment
that I had some work to do,
as opposed to maybe joining
a team that's on the top,
and you've got kind of only one way to go.
[suspenseful music playing]
[cameras clicking]
[Will Buxton] Winter testing is
the first opportunity that we get
to see the new cars for this year
out on track.
It's really a first opportunity
for the teams to put their cars
through their paces,
to see if they're as good
as they hope they're gonna be,
if they're as fast as they hope
they're gonna be,
and crucially, if they are reliable.
The stakes have really never been higher
for McLaren.
They are trying to rebuild themselves into
a competitive championship-winning team.
After so many years of disappointment,
if they don't get it right this year,
they're gonna lose their driver.
[scattered cheering]
I think Fernando is
one of the best drivers
in the history of Formula One.
I don't think there is a team
that wouldn't love to have Fernando
in their racing car.
So, to have him stay with us, I think,
is a big vote of confidence
of how he feels we will race this year.
My name is Fernando Alonso.
I am two times world champion
and I race for McLaren.
I have a lot of power on the things
that I may say,
so I feel that responsibility,
that leadership, and I try to guide
the team in the best way possible.
[Brown] I feel confident this year.
We wanna come out pretty strong
and demonstrate
that we're gonna be back
to our winning ways.
[Alonso] Radio check.
[engineer] Okay, Fernando.
Yeah, that sounded clear for me.
[Alonso] Winter testing is always a moment
of the year where we are all optimistic.
We have a lot of trust
and faith on the car.
We try to stretch the car, you know,
to the maximum.
[engineer] Okay, nice work, Fernando.
I need multi-function C2,
position four, please.
[Alonso] Yes, okay.
When I joined the team, we were
fighting for the world championship
and that was a different role
than what we have now,
which is trying to fight back and bring
the team back to the top positions.
[engineer] Okay, Fernando,
this pace is really good.
[Alonso] Copy.
[tires squealing]
-[man] Alonso.
-[man 2] It is Alonso!
Alonso's had a crash. Well, he's gone off.
A wheel has come off his car.
[Buxton] It's rare
this happens in testing.
It's better that it happens now than
it happens once you get to the first race.
But it's... shall we say,
it's a worrying thing to happen?
Fernando's not gonna be happy.
[Alonso] In Formula One, it's not easy
to hide anything in winter testing.
[chatter]
If we assume that it's like this
for the rest of the day...
Then we go to another plan.
[Alonso] So many people
and so many cameras.
There are a lot of eyes on everyone.
Yeah.
We need to have this?
At this crucial moment?
I don't want to...
[man] Go and handle it. Go.
[Croft] We are ready for a cracking
2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
The paddock is really
starting to come to life.
I'm excited. Excited to be back here.
Obviously, I'd love to win.
It should be a fun race.
[Croft] The race that could just
conjure up anything in the next 51 laps.
And you can feel it,
the pressure in the air.
[Cyril Abiteboul] Make sure to be
very clear in your analysis of the tires.
But it's better to have--
Even if one is the best,
it's better to have two optimized
than one that is...
-One and a half?
-Yeah. Not-- Not half for a grand prix.
The electronics...
[Abiteboul] 2018 has to be
a season where Renault
shows that we are progressing...
and for our ambition to be fighting at
the top in a few years' time is credible.
My name is Cyril Abiteboul.
I am Managing Director
of Renault Sport Formula One.
But what's fantastic
is our line-up of drivers.
Carlos and Nico
is one of the strongest in the grid.
[loud grinding]
-You won't make it...
-No, there was no turning back.
The midfield is extremely tight.
McLaren, right now, uh...
they are our most direct competitor.
If we have the ability to beat them,
it will say a lot about
the progression of Renault.
We need to deliver
what people are expecting from us.
If I don't deliver... I'm fired.
[laughs]
[Sainz] There's always gonna be people
making mistakes in Baku.
For me, it's one of the most
challenging tracks
in Formula One at the moment.
[cheering]
[Karel Loos] And just a reminder about
the tailwinds in three, four, 15 and 16.
[Sainz] If you stay out of trouble,
you could actually think about
a top five finish.
[Alonso] Radio check.
[engineer] Yeah, Fernando,
loud and clear for me.
[Alonso] It is the fastest street circuit
in the world and you know
always that gives a lot of adrenaline
for the spectators.
And for drivers as well.
[Croft] So the cars begin
the formation lap in Baku,
one more chance to warm their tires
and warm their brakes...
[Abiteboul] It's a very particular track,
because you've got the first sector
that is dominated
by ninety-degree corners.
If you talk to the drivers,
they'll tell you that it's like driving
very, very fast in a cage.
Then you've got sector two,
which is very twisty in the old town.
So, that's very different.
Sector three is pretty much
one corner and a straight.
Okay, Fernando, five seconds to go.
[engines roaring]
[Croft] It's a dash down to turn one then,
who's gonna come out on top?
So far, all getting away cleanly.
And there's damage!
[Alonso] Wow, it's full of debris.
[Croft] There's contact
down into turn two!
Fernando Alonso and Sirotkin
going wheel to wheel.
[Croft] Oh, no!
There's contact for Fernando Alonso.
[engineer] Puncture switch.
Puncture switch.
[Croft] And Ocon in a collision.
Ocon is out of the race!
[Alonso] Unbelievable.
You take care in corner one, corner two,
and they crash into you.
Fucking stupid!
It's a black flag situation.
What this guy's been doing?
Destroy the complete race.
We had two punctures
and the car was nearly undriveable.
[wheel buzzing]
[Alonso] Okay, I need to box.
It was not fair to have that damaged car
on lap one
and not having the possibility
to fight back.
You know, that anger to go back
to the pit lane and change those tires--
You know, the desire of "keep racing".
It was not the moment to retire that car.
[Brown] I think most drivers
would have parked the car
and wouldn't have even thought
about continuing in the race.
[tools whirring]
Okay, Fernando, the race isn't over
for us. The race isn't over.
[engine roaring]
[Loos] Okay, Carlos, how is the balance?
[Sainz] Yeah, all good.
[Croft] Here goes Carlos Sainz.
He's up in sixth place.
Tries to go around the outside.
Nothing doing.
[Sainz] At that point in the race,
I really started attacking
and really pushing flat out.
Carlos Sainz. He's on Verstappen's tail.
Brilliant racing from all three drivers.
My name is Carlos Onoro,
I'm Carlos Sainz's manager and his cousin.
[chuckles] I mean, for me,
it's heart attack after heart attack.
Qualifying until the end of the race,
it's like a roller-coaster.
[speaking Spanish]
[di Resta]
Carlos Sainz looking very racy...
[Croft] And it means a lot
to be racing against Red Bull
and to be pressuring them.
[Onoro] In a race like Baku where you see
that he's fighting for fourth,
for fifth position, which is not normal,
it's always exciting.
[Croft] Verstappen might go
down the inside. And he does so!
A podium is always something
that you are aiming for.
The difficulty is that there
are three top teams,
two cars each.
That's already sixth position.
That leaves little room for us,
but who knows?
Maybe there will be
that opportunity for us,
and we need to be sure to seize
that opportunity if it's given.
[engine revving]
[Croft] Sainz swoops
round the outside of Verstappen.
Nice move there
from the driver in the Renault.
[crew cheering]
[Sainz] Tires are super soft.
I'm starting to degrade a bit
at the rear tires.
I'm going to start losing time
with the Red Bulls.
[engineer] Okay, so, box this lap.
Box this lap.
[Sainz] Coming.
[Croft] Carlos Sainz into the pits, then.
He's had to let the Red Bulls go.
[tools whirring]
[engine roars]
[Sainz] The Red Bulls had pulled away.
They were ten, fifteen seconds ahead of me
and they were both fighting each other.
Ricciardo desperate
to get past Max Verstappen.
But Verstappen aggressively defending
against his teammate.
[tires screeching]
[crew muttering]
-[Loos] Yellow flags turn one. Take care.
-[man] Yellow turn one.
-[Loos] Debris at turn one.
-[man] Double yellow at turn one.
Both Red Bulls off at turn one.
That's 25, 30 points
we just fucked away there.
[Onoro] When you are driving for one
of the teams in the midfield,
I'm not gonna say I would celebrate
the top team's crashing into each other,
but if Carlos goes up two places
because the drivers decide to collide,
it's good for him,
and he gained two places for free.
[man] Safety car. Safety car.
Safety car in this lap.
[Sainz] Okay, which position am I?
[Loos] You're currently P-7.
[Sainz] Okay.
Now we've got--
I don't know how many laps to go,
but not many until the end,
so... new tires.
We need to overtake Grosjean.
[Croft] Right, onboard then with Grosjean.
He's weaving around, trying to get
temperature into the tires...
And he's gone and crashed!
Oh! Ooh. There you go.
[Loos] Okay, Grosjean crashed.
Nice one. P-6.
Safety car...
I'm fucking speechless.
I cannot fucking believe it.
That's how quick things can change
in Formula One.
Ouch.
[Croft] Back with Fernando Alonso.
[engineer] Fernando, you're doing
an amazing job. This pace is really good.
[Alonso] Okay.
[Sainz] Okay, guys,
how many laps to the end are we now?
[Loos] Seven laps remaining now.
You're gaining four-tenths per lap
to the cars ahead.
-Keep focus.
-[Sainz] Copy.
[tires squealing]
[Croft] There's a puncture
for Valtteri Bottas!
[Brundle] It's a flat!
He ran across some debris.
[all] Oh!
Ah, tire failure!
[Sainz] At that point, I remember thinking
about giving it a shot
at that podium place.
Let's go, Carlos.
[cheering]
[in Spanish] Let's go, let's go.
[Loos] We have two laps remaining now.
[Sainz] Copy.
[Croft] Sainz has pulled out
from behind the slipstream.
Nice move, there.
And he's now up into fifth place.
[Loos] Nice job, Carlos. We need
to focus on the last lap. The last lap.
Copy.
[Croft] Hamilton takes the checkered flag
and Carlos Sainz comes home
to finish in fifth.
[car downshifts]
That means Fernando Alonso finishes
as the second Spaniard in this race.
-[Loos] Nice job, mate. P-5, well done.
-[Sainz] Good job, guys.
[Croft] Following his earlier incident,
it's amazing Alonso finished at all.
Only a driver of his caliber
could've gotten that car to the end.
Well, you feel proud of your team,
of your, um, abilities also,
driving that car,
of your commitment.
You ended up with a P-7 and you feel,
very, very proud of that drive.
It was, by far, the best race
of the season for me, personally.
Despite the start, we will fight
until the checkered flag.
-You did great. Podium next.
-Yeah.
[Abiteboul] Finishing fifth
was the best team result
since we returned to Formula One.
But we are still behind McLaren
in terms of the championship.
-Well done, mate. Nice drive.
-Thank you.
[Sainz] It was one of those weekends
that you go back home really happy
because you've contributed
to a very big team result.
Yeah, really good.
The Red Bulls were all over the place.
Thank you.
You guys must have been enjoying it
from the outside.
Yeah, we did. Yeah, yeah.
LeClerc got
a very good slipstream from me.
But then I got him back easily.
I said, "This guy is not beating me.
No fucking way."
[laughs]
I went-- I went bananas to him like...
[announcer] Azerbaijan Automobile
Federation. Well done, gentlemen.
[cheering]
[Sainz in Spanish] No, no, no. Come on!
No, no.
[Sainz in English]
Every time I'm in Spain,
I try to organize a dinner at home.
[in Spanish]
How badly they’re playing!
[in English] You get
to disconnect a bit from the races
and you really get to have fun.
[in Spanish] That's a foul!
Don't let him go. Of course.
[laughs] I love it.
[Onoro in English] Carlos, he's
my younger cousin, so we are very close.
We've been very close
since he was born, basically.
-[in Spanish] Hey! Fuck off, man!
-I can't believe it.
No shit. What a shitty pass, Marcelo.
[Onoro in English] His father is my uncle.
Even if you haven't heard
about Carlos Sainz, the motorsport legend,
when you meet him,
you can tell he's a powerful guy.
-[in Spanish] Damn it! Come on man!
-Come on please!
Look! Cheat, cheat! Damn!
[Onoro in English] And obviously,
if you know something about sports,
Carlos's father is an icon of motor sport.
For Carlos Junior, growing up with his dad
has had positives and negatives.
You've got free advice from a legend.
At the same time,
I think it was a little bit tough
because everywhere
that Carlos went racing,
he was, like, pointed out that,
"Look, that's the son of Carlos Sainz.
I wanna beat that guy."
That kind of jealousy,
he has had to prove a lot of people wrong.
[Sainz Sr.] If I could be invisible,
I would love to be invisible.
-[Sainz Sr. in Spanish] How's it going?
-Good.
[Sainz Sr. in English]
This is his life, his sport, his time.
I have been enough time in the camera,
so I'm quite happy to leave him alone.
[Sainz] Obviously, I know that my dad
is a very famous name.
I'm incredibly proud to be his son,
but me, personally,
I want to create my own name,
my own career in Formula One.
[Sainz Sr.] Carlos is still growing,
he's still maturing, somehow,
and I remember
how I was with 22, 23.
He's quite smart... sometimes.
[chuckles]
[woman] Ollie!
[Sainz laughs] Aw! Look at this!
This is not a dog.
This is... a piece of shit!
Carlos!
[clamoring]
[announcer in Spanish]
Everyone, the F1 world champion.
Give a big hand to Fernando Alonso!
[cheering]
Fernando Alonso!
[Alonso] Hi, everyone. Well, the truth is…
[Alonso in English] It is emotional
racing in Spain for me.
You know, it is once a year
that you have the home Grand Prix.
[announcer in English]
Please do not push.
For safety reasons,
please do not push, por favor.
[Alonso] You know, the amount of work
you put off track to make people happy,
to sign as many autographs as possible,
to take time for the kids,
to take pictures,
to give presents, you know,
whatever you can do to make people happy,
you try to do it that weekend.
Fernando!
[crowd cheering]
They want us to do a lap in these ones,
but we cannot fit in the seats. Too small.
Yeah, it is a bit.
I've not been go-karting in fucking years.
-Yeah?
-I'm too old. [laughs]
Still fun. Still good fun.
Yeah, I haven't done it for so long.
[Alonso] Karting has been, for me,
probably the best part
of my racing career.
I've been in go-karts
for more than 15 years
and probably the best memories
are coming from that part of my life.
Yeah. None?
To hold on, it's hard. So hard.
[Alonso in Spanish]
You ahve to go little by little.
[boy] We can't overtake?
You can't, no.
It's just an exhibition today.
But you overtake.
Today is just an exhibition.
Today we came here
to see you taking it easy.
[Alonso in English]
When you start racing
and you jump in a go-kart
for the first time...
um, there is some kind of, uh, freedom.
[engines rumbling]
As a kid, you normally follow your parents
and your friends
and your teacher at the school.
Everything is always
behind, uh, some rules.
The first time you are behind the wheel,
you are yourself and you are alone
on the race track.
That feeling, I think, together
with the speed and with the adrenaline,
is something
that is difficult not to fall in love.
[band playing flamenco music]
[Sainz] My dad comes nearly to every race,
maybe 16, 17 races a year out of 21.
My sisters and my mom told me
that he gets a bit too nervous
if he doesn't come
to a Grand Prix weekend.
[Sainz Sr. in Spanish] Come on!
I reckon Grosjean's not coming
around turn one.
[laughs]
What do you reckon?
-He might make one, but two...
-Okay, yeah. [laughs]
[commentator] In the midfield,
all Spanish eyes
will be looking
at  Fernando Alonso in the McLaren
and Carlos Sainz in the Renault.
Alonso's in eighth, just one place
ahead of his fellow Spaniard.
Just do what we agreed.
[Sainz] I am a competitive guy.
I always visualize winning.
That guy who was your hero,
your killer instinct immediately comes in
and you suddenly take it
as one rival more that you want to beat.
When you are on the grid,
you go into that zone,
into that moment of,
"this is just a car and yourself."
Compete, race, win.
You just need to deliver.
-[Loos] And radio check, Carlos.
-[Sainz] Yeah, all good.
[Abiteboul] There is
only one guy who's allowed
to talk to the driver
when he's out there on track.
It's a race engineer,
and for Carlos, it's Karel.
[Loos] Okay, Carlos. Good luck, mate.
[man] Last car approaching the grid.
[Sainz exhales]
[engines roaring]
[Croft] And it's a good start
for Carlos Sainz.
[in Spanish] Let's go.
[Croft] Can he keep
ahead of Alonso into turn one?
Oh, he just manages it.
But he's out wide and in the gravel.
That's Alonso's chance
to go out round the outside,
he's in trouble too.
And off is Grosjean!
[screeching]
[Croft] Massive accident.
That looks like Romain Grosjean
very much out of this race.
Oh, and there's a Renault
involved as well.
Is that Carlos Sainz? I think it is.
[groaning]
-Is that Carlos?
-Shit!
[Croft] No, that looks like
Nico Hülkenberg.
Hülkenberg is out of this race.
That's Hülkenberg!
[Neal] It was Grosjean.
Exactly why I said at the beginning,
I said he's not coming around turn one.
[laughs]
[Croft] We can get racing once again.
Sainz is up in eighth place.
[man] And Sainz is pressuring
Magnussen for seventh.
Tries to go around the outside
at turn three.
Not gonna get through there.
Down into eleventh.
And here's Alonso in eleventh. He's now
trying to attack Ocon in the same way
and he is going to go around the outside.
He's still got it, hasn't he?
What a move!
Okay, Carlos, so box this lap.
[Sainz] Coming in, Carlos, pit lane.
[Loos] So you will be close
to Ericsson on pit exit.
[Sainz] Okay.
[tools whirring]
[tires screeching]
[Croft] Alonso's caught Hartley
on the straight. And he's got him.
Sainz is going for it here
with Marcus Ericsson.
Trying to go around the outside.
Ericsson just leans on him.
[Brundle] Oh, they're gonna touch,
aren't they?
[Croft] That is some great
side-by-side action.
Unbelievably close.
[crew chief]
He has to look after his tires.
Our race isn't with Ericsson, mate.
[Croft] Sainz is desperate
to overtake Ericsson.
But Ericsson is long overdue a pit stop.
Don't forget, these tires need to last
Sainz until the end of the Grand Prix.
[Sainz] Why I cannot pass?
He's too fast on the straight.
[crew chief] Keep him calm. Keep him calm.
He doesn't need to pass.
And it's the cars behind
he needs to worry about.
Does he know that's
LeClerc and Alonso behind him?
Okay, Carlos,
behind you have LeClerc and Alonso.
Let's stay calm.
We need to focus on tires.
[Sainz] Copy.
In the race, you go into
that more aggressive mode.
You know that you are
in your home Grand Prix
and you know that you need to make moves
to try and gain positions,
to try and put on a good show.
[crew chief] His race is with LeClerc
and Alonso behind, not Ericsson.
[Loos] That's what I just told him.
[Turner] Well, tell him again,
and tell him to drop back
and stop fucking racing him. Please.
If you won't tell him, I will tell him.
He's going to wear his fronts out,
and we're gonna lose this race.
[Loos] Look after the tires
and bring it home, please.
[Croft] Marcus Ericsson is finally
off to the pits,
unleashing Sainz into seventh place.
But just behind is Charles LeClerc,
who's getting passed by Fernando Alonso.
Alonso in eighth now.
[Loos] Next car behind you now
is Alonso.
Six laps to go.
[man] We just had quite a pressure drop
through turn three.
[Loos] When you say "drop,"
you mean a little tiny, wincey one
or something to be scared of?
[man] Quite scared, yeah.
We were down to around two bar.
[Loos] Okay.
[Sainz] Oh, the engine, engine.
-[Loos] It's fuel pressure.
-[Sainz] I had a fuel drop-out.
[crew chief]
Turn the engine up, please, Karel.
[Loos] Scenario one, scenario one.
[Croft] Sainz has engine trouble.
He'll be down on power
for these final few laps.
[woman in Spanish] Broken?
I cannot believe it,
we were so close to the end.
[Croft] Carlos Sainz has Fernando Alonso
breathing down his neck.
[crew chief] Right, what can we do
through three?
We can go a little bit easier
through three
-so we don't get those drop-outs?
-[engineer] I'll suggest that.
[Loos] It will help,
but it probably won't stop it.
Okay, Carlos, we need to take it easy
through turn three.
[Sainz] How easy? Like, how much?
[Loos] We need a big lift-off.
[crew chief] Like that is good.
Like that is very good.
[Loos] Okay, keep doing that, please.
Alonso is eight seconds behind,
eight seconds behind.
[Sainz] So, I really needed to slow down,
but at the same time,
I had Fernando pushing behind me.
[engineer] Okay, Fernando,
Sainz is slowing.
Now I want 100% focus on Sainz.
[Alonso] Okay.
[in Spanish] He said, "Engine, engine."
He has to take the third turn very slowly.
[woman] You'll see how Fernando
pushes now.
[Croft] Fernando Alonso has just put in
his fastest lap of the race.
[Loos] Okay, Carlos, five laps to go.
[Sainz] I asked to my engineer
to keep telling me
the lap times of Fernando.
[Loos] Okay, two laps to go,
and a five-second gap to Alonso behind.
[dramatic music playing]
[engineer] Fernando, last lap
you were two seconds quicker than Sainz.
-[man] One lap left, right?
-[woman] One lap.
[Croft] Alonso
is continuing to gain on Sainz.
[Loos] This is the last lap.
[Sainz] We didn't know
if we were gonna make it.
[Reyes in Spanish] There it is, come on.
[Croft] And there's Carlos Sainz!
[Brundle] And the Renault does it!
Finishing seventh in front
of McLaren's Fernando Alonso.
[applause]
[woman in Spanish] What a relief.
Look where Fernando had him already.
Up to his neck.
[Loos] Nice job, mate, P-7, P-7.
Well done.
[Abiteboul]
Good job, Carlos. We beat McLaren.
Ah, when he opened the radio and went,
"Engine, engine, engine,"
-it's like, "No fucking way."
-I know.
Great to get ahead of Alonso at the start.
And McLaren. We've overtook them
in the championship.
[Brown] We had some high hopes.
I think we are the underdogs now.
It's not a place McLaren is used to being.
So, we dropped one point behind Renault.
[Abiteboul]
It's a very decent finish for us.
I think we have a team that is definitely,
finally starting to believe.
[Sainz Sr.] Fernando was, you know,
the first world champion
in Formula One for Spain.
Carlos has a great respect for him.
You know, he's competing with his hero.
[Sainz] Good job, guys. Good job.
Fernando is the best driver
in motor sport at the moment.
So, I know I'm fighting against the best,
even if it's for P-7.
[Onoro] Obviously, Fernando and Carlos
are a different generation.
[cheering]
Carlos knows he's the next Spanish driver
in Formula One,
but he wants to do things his own way.
It's incredible, no? How life is?
You know, when I met him when I was ten,
who would've told me that,
14 years later,
I would've ended up
battling against the best.
-[Sainz] Okay, cheers, guys.
-[all] Cheers!
[Daniel] This year, I have to look
for another contract.
[man] Daniel is very much at a crossroads.
[Daniel] What if I just break free?
[Buxton] Max is their chosen star.
[Daniel] The better I do,
the better offers I get.
Until I lift that trophy,
I won't be satisfied.
This is my time.
It's my fucking time.
[Croft] What has happened
to Daniel Ricciardo?
[Daniel] I'm losing power...
[flamenco music playing]How pissed off were you that day?
Very.
[crowd cheering]
[engines roaring]
[Croft] The two Red Bulls go through.
Ricciardo fends off Max Verstappen.
[Horner] We talked about it
before the race.
Both drivers had nodded in agreement
that they'd give each other space.
[Croft] If you're Christian Horner,
you are not enjoying this for one second.
Verstappen is in no mood whatsoever
to yield to his teammate.
[tires squealing]
[Croft] They have crashed!
They've gone into each other!
It was a low point, and I made my feelings
very clear to both drivers.
Fuck!
That's 25, 30 points
we've just fucked away there.
[Max] We were fighting for positions, but,
yeah, of course, you never want to crash
with your teammate.
[Daniel] I was sure of what happened.
You know, I was sure
that I wasn't the cause of it.
I was kind of made to feel guilty.
This year, I'm gonna be out of contract,
and I think, "What am I gonna achieve
doing one more year with Red Bull?"
You know, I could be happier...
having a fresh start.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
-[Geri] Bernie, Flavvy. Come here.
-[Horner] Come on.
-Bernie, come  here.
-[girl] Bernie.
-Go on, back you go.
-He got kicked by a donkey yesterday.
Come on.
[Geri] Look what we've got.
[Horner] Look who's here.
-Max and Daniel.
-Yeah. [laughs]
They are very similar to a couple
of donkeys on occasion.
[Geri] Sometimes they love each other,
and sometimes they butt each other.
In fact, managing donkeys
is sometimes easier than...
managing drivers.
All these drivers,
they all have slight insecurities,
like any great sportsman.
Life has been made difficult at the moment
because we've got
this exciting emerging talent
in Max Verstappen.
Max isn't yet 21,
so, I think that they're just drivers
at different stages in their career.
By the time we get to the August break,
I'm going to be ready for some time off.
Yeah.
It's gonna be an important year
for Daniel in his career
because he's very much at a crossroads.
We'd love to extend the agreement
with him, but, do you know what?
If he doesn't want to be here,
that's Formula One.
It's-- It's a big boy sport.
[Geri] So, what's coming up
in the next few races?
-[Horner] Um, Monaco, next race.
-[Geri] Is this one of your favorites?
[Horner] Yeah. Be good to see Max
get a result.
[Geri] Yeah.
[Glenn Beavis] So, they want an answer
from us as early as possible.
Who's out of contract then?
-Uh...
-Well, Lewis is going...
[Beavis] Lewis, Kimi, and Valtteri.
If Valtteri has a bad year,
how long are they gonna give him
before they make a decision about
-whether they want to keep him?
-Yeah, exactly.
[Daniel] Since joining Red Bull,
it's the first time I've ever had
to look for another contract or kind
of been in a position to negotiate,
to have discussions with other teams.
[Beavis] What's being weighed up by us now
is whether or not we make one
of those tactical moves somewhere else,
and the question is obviously, "Where?"
[Daniel] I guess the only thing
on my mind is get results now,
because the better I do, the better offers
I'm gonna have probably from other teams.
I obviously want to be fighting
for the World Championship.
Based on things as they are right now,
Merc and Ferrari would be there.
They're two obvious candidates,
but, you know...
anything can happen.
Yeah.
I don't really want to rush right now.
While Red Bull Racing are nowhere near
the competitive force that they were
when they won four
world championships in a row,
I think that pales into insignificance
when you see where Williams are
compared to where they were
at that same point in time.
[Claire Williams] Birdie.
-[baby gurgling]
-[Claire imitating car]
Vroom, vroom, vroom.
[Marc] Goes faster than our car.
[Claire laughing]
[Claire gasping]
You didn't hear that, Nate.
[laughing]
So, I am Claire Williams,
and I am the deputy team principal
of the Williams Martini Racing team.
Arms up. Ah, good boy.
Aw. [laughs]
Williams is everything to me.
It's been in my family throughout
my whole life.
Started by my dad, Frank Williams,
back in 1977.
So, we've been racing for 41 years now.
It became an enormous success story
of the eighties and nineties...
winning 16 world championships,
114 races,
and all as a small, independent team
started by a boy with a dream
when he was very, very young.
My youth was spent
helping out around the team.
So, it really is everything.
It's a big part of what defines me.
But I do believe
since I took on my job back in 2013,
the world in which we operate
is a very different place
to when Williams first started.
They were up in third in 2014 and 2015,
but they've slowly been slipping back
and that's a hard thing to turn around.
[tires screeching]
[Claire] We face
much greater competition.
We face much more
challenging circumstances
in which we have to race
and operate our team.
But sport's not supposed to be easy.
Winning isn't easy, and that's why
it's so amazing when you do,
because you deserve it,
and at the moment,
we don't deserve to win.
We've got to put the work in
if we're going to change that.
In just five years, they've gone from
fighting for pole positions and podiums
to scraping to get off the last row
of the grid.
[Claire] You know, there's always a lot
of criticism, but you can't listen to it.
You just have to keep going
and believe that what you are doing
will make changes.
Now Williams are going to be getting to
the stage where they're trying to work out
if there's an ingrained problem
they need to change
Do they need to change
their whole outlook?
[Paddy Lowe] Um, this car
has not been performing as we'd expect.
The first few races, we were literally
the slowest team on the track.
[Claire] I've been given
a wonderful opportunity,
and I only agreed to do it
because I thought at the time
that I could help
turn the business around.
To be very clear, we aren't going down
that road of a B-team.
Any of you that know me well would know
that it would be over my dead body.
You will never read in the press
that Williams has
turned itself
into a junior team or a B-team.
I've got this whole history
that I need to protect.
If, under my watch, that were all
to go horribly, horribly wrong,
it would be my fault.
[Medland] Monaco looks like
it could be a painful weekend.
The car is clearly
the slowest in the field,
and more than just Formula One fans
watch Monaco,
because it's bonkers.
[Daniel] Monaco is
my favorite race on the calendar.
It's the most...
Monaco's the big one.
It's where all the glitterati are.
[cheering]
You've got the boats...
the harbor...
the celebrities.
It just exudes money,
glamour.
It's just a lot of cool shit
in a small space.
[grunts]
[crowd cheering]
Monaco is Monaco.
It's the oldest race on the calendar.
It's the prestigious one.
So much heritage. So much history.
[commentator]
It's an absolutely incredible sight.
The cars roaring
round the circuit at fantastic speed.
[Horner] The track
is the same that it has been
for pretty much all 76 Grand Prix.
All the greats have raced
and won in Monaco.
Fangio,
Graham Hill,
Ayrton Senna.
The pressure and the prestige
that goes with that race,
if you come out on top,
winning that Grand Prix,
it's bigger than anything else.
[Medland] From a Red Bull perspective,
they'll have targeted this
from the very start the season.
Their car will be suited
to the Monaco Grand Prix circuit,
but Daniel will want to stand out,
because they've seemed to be putting
more and more weight
behind Max Verstappen for its future.
[fans clamoring]
Well, Max has got
that sort of magic dust around him.
He's the next generation coming through.
[Max] I like that one.
[man] That is ridiculous.
Yeah. How much do you think
that boat costs?
[Max] One point eight.
[man] One point eight?
[Max] 'Cause I've been
on that one in, uh, Ibiza.
[man] Oh, yeah?
Honestly, you lose yourself on the boat
like compared to like...
You have to call other people like,
"Where are you  on the boat?"
[man] Well, it's like a cruise ship.
My name is Max Verstappen,
driving for Aston Martin Red Bull Racing
in Formula One,
and I'm also
the youngest Formula One winner.
So, I live in Monaco. For me, it's just...
like I'm at home really.
Just a bit busier.
We are used to, like,
a hotel during a race weekend, so...
[man] You have to do your own
clothes washing?
No. Luckily, my mom is here, so...
What would it mean for a driver
in Daniel's position
to know that this kid
who's come in as the young buck
is promised more than he's on?
That's gonna hurt.
[Daniel] I mean, look,
they've invested a lot in Max.
One thing that Red Bull love to do
is create headlines, break records.
If he could be the youngest ever
world champion,
that's-- that's a dream scenario for them.
[Medland] There's clearly gonna be
tension within the team.
They're both fighting, in a sense,
for number one status.
Verstappen has the contract in place.
Daniel's looking for a new one...
and that will be playing on Daniel's mind.
Max is clearly one of the big names
of Formula One for the next ten years,
but Daniel is still
hugely important to Red Bull.
[loud dance music playing]
I just want you to know that
there are no number one drivers here.
You know, nothing would give us
greater pleasure than to see him...
achieve the world championship
in one of our cars.
[Buxton] Whatever he says,
I don't believe that's the relationship,
and I think Max is
their chosen star for the future.
And I hope he feels he's got...
you know, he's got
a huge amount of support in the team.
You know, there's no pressure
to have the youngest world champion
or anything like that.
[Daniel] If they really want me,
they need to put something awesome
in front of me and snap me up.
[cameras clicking]
[woman] Thanks!
-[man] Super.
-[woman] Thank you. See you on Friday.
-[Daniel] Thanks very much. See you later.
-Thank you so much. See you on Friday.
I think Monaco's going to be
a very tough race for us.
I hope that our little cars
get through it in one piece...
-and we get some points.
-Yes.
[Claire] If we don't start scoring points,
that gap's just going to widen to a point
where we're not in the mix anymore.
We'll finish tenth.
No one wants to come last in any sport,
but particularly so in Formula One.
And it's all to do with money.
There's a sliding scale of payments,
and being bottom means
they get the smallest slice of pie.
The Ferraris, Mercedes,
they're all spending, you know...
north
of three, four hundred million dollars.
But our budget at Williams
is somewhat smaller than that
at about 125 sterling a year.
To win in Formula One, you need...
you need money.
[Lance] This sport requires
financial help,
and that financial help
has to come from somewhere.
I'm Lance Stroll. I'm 19 years old,
and this is my second season
with Williams Martini Racing.
[Claire] Yeah, I think
it's no great secret
that Lawrence has made an investment
based on his son having a seat.
And I don't think it can be underestimated
the impact that that can have.
[Lance] Wait. Oh, yeah. All right.
-[horn honks]
-[camera clicking]
But I also have to believe that he has
the best interests of the team at heart.
[Lance] I know I'm born
with a silver spoon in my mouth,
but I've seen
paid drivers in the past not deliver.
But when I look at my rookie season,
I've proved a lot of people wrong.
Finishing on a podium,
starting on a front row.
Those are all big achievements,
if you ask me.
I strive to be the best I can be.
This is all the same, right?
This hasn't been resurfaced.
Well, supposedly, it's from seven
all the way around to 15.
Yeah, this one...
-has caught out a couple of people.
-Yeah. [chuckles]
[Buxton] Lawrence is a businessman,
and you don't keep throwing your money
at something that's not working for you.
So, for as long as the team provides
the basis for his boy to be able
to show what he can do,
then you can see him
still being a part of it.
But the second that doesn't happen,
you can be sure he's going to take
his money somewhere else.
[Lance] This year with Williams,
on and off the track,
has been a frustrating experience.
I'm not gonna lie.
Yeah, there's, uh...
hopefully better times ahead.
[crowd cheering]
[Brundle] It's the team's last chance
to get their cars set up right
ahead of qualifying this afternoon.
You know, we've got a good package here.
The drivers are in great shape.
You know, they both enjoy this track.
The car looks super...
Daniel, how does it feel...
[reporter] ...to work yourselves
back into this championship?
-Still some unfinished business.
-[man] And you've come here to win?
To make the difference,
you have to risk it a bit more.
-[woman] Red Bull are the favorites.
-[man] The favorites, do you feel as such?
I'm just looking forward to get started.
[crowd cheering]
[Horner] Our car works well in Monaco,
because Monaco has
the least straights of the year,
which means horsepower isn't everything,
so therefore, we're able to compensate
with a great chassis
and give the drivers confidence
they can run up close to the barriers.
They can extract that lap time
from the cars.
[Medland] If you're Red Bull right now,
you really want to see
Max Verstappen win this race,
because you've invested in him.
You've put your faith in him
for the future,
but it's so hard to overtake.
You've got to do it in qualifying,
and that means pushing
to the absolute limit,
and that's why Saturday
is spectacular here.
[Daniel] I've always come
into Monaco fired up.
It's the most difficult circuit
on the calendar.
It's the circuit with
the most smallest margin for error.
[Max] I think a race win
is definitely possible here in Monaco.
I've been...
I think, driving a lot better.
I've been in qualifying
really strong compared to Daniel as well.
I'm feeling good.
[Brundle] Finally a chance to see
if Red Bull really are in fighting form
as Max Verstappen heads out for practice.
[Croft] Max Verstappen makes his way
onto the track.
[Brundle] This will be a good indication
of what he'll be able to do
come qualifying this afternoon.
Well, Max has got that sort of
magic, beautiful driving style.
[Max] It is a tough track.
It's always, you know, bumpy, low grip.
If you have a little slide,
you can end up in the wall.
[Croft] Max Verstappen
on the fastest lap of the session so far.
[Horner] You won't meet any driver
hungrier than Max Verstappen.
He wants to be fastest on every session,
every race. It's fantastic.
[Croft] Oh, someone's hit a barrier.
It's Max Verstappen.
One of the favorites for pole position
later on this afternoon
has absolutely clobbered the barriers.
[Horner] You just think, "Fuck it."
He was just pushing too hard, too soon.
He made a silly mistake.
[man] Red flag for a Red Bull.
It's a red flag.
Stay to the left-hand side.
It's parked to the right.
He's given his team a massive
repair job to get that car ready
for the qualifying session.
[Verstappen] It is painful,
because if it has a bad outcome...
you are even more angry.
[Horner] You've got a pretty small window
of time of about two hours
to get the car turned around
and into qualifying.
I've got confidence in the mechanics,
but there's nothing guaranteed.
[Croft] Max Verstappen's chips
scattered right now.
What are the odds of his car
making qualifying after his earlier crash?
[man] Arguably, the most exciting
qualifying session of the season
is here in Monte Carlo.
Qualifying today, very, very important.
Lance Stroll in the Williams
heading out for his session.
[Lance] Loud and clear.
[Urwin] Thank you.
Showing Luca on the radio.
-[Baldisserri] Loud and clear.
-Thank you.
[Claire] See how he goes this afternoon.
Lance struggled moving around a lot
in the seat in the first session.
He was moving around too much.
So, anyway, they've tried to fix it.
-Tell me that was fixed.
-It hasn't happened before.
-No, it's the first time all season.
-Okay, well, let's hope it's a one-off.
They think the belts
were just getting loose all session.
Okay. All right.
Let's hope it's a one-off then, Lawrence.
Target for now, plus 30 seconds.
Taking temp out of the rear.
[man] It's quite busy into the corner now.
Everybody on slow laps.
[Lance] The fricking headrest is loose.
-Fucking hell.
-It's okay.
[Lance] Just fix it.
[man] Okay, we'll do it next time around.
Okay, Lance. We need four tenths,
and we need a twelve nine
to get through, okay?
[Lance] I'm really suffering with traction
and all those kind of things.
Oh, this is on the edge now.
Too much understeer, guys.
It can't go quicker like this.
[Croft] And that's a 1:13.3
for Lance Stroll.
Another disappointing performance
for Williams.
They'll be starting towards
the back of the grid on race day.
Breaking news from Red Bull.
Max Verstappen, one of the favorites
to take poll this afternoon
out of qualifying
before he even gets going.
[Horner]
We managed to get the car turned around,
but, unfortunately,
when firing up the engine,
suddenly we saw a big oil leak
from the gear box.
There was no chance then
to make the qualifying.
He's a very, very fast driver.
We know that. That's not within any doubt.
This place bites hard if you abuse it,
and unfortunately, there's no more
brutal lesson than what he's just had,
so, uh, you know, I'm sure that he's
smart enough to hopefully learn from that.
[Croft] All Red Bull's hopes now rest
with Daniel Ricciardo.
Can he beat Ferrari and Mercedes
to start in pole position on race day?
[cheering]
[Brundle] Lewis Hamilton is flying.
Here comes Vettel.
[Rennie] Okay, mate. Currently P1...
Six tenths quicker
than everyone else at the moment.
-[Daniel] So everyone's slow behind?
-[Rennie] Yeah, everyone's slow behind.
Hülkenberg behind is slow.
Räikkönen also slow behind him.
[Horner] Grid position is everything.
If you drive in the middle of the road
in a race,
it's almost impossible for the car behind
to be able to overtake.
So, the intensity of qualifying
becomes even more important.
[Daniel] The streets of Monaco
are so tight.
Everything's coming at you so fast.
[Croft] Max Verstappen watches on.
He can do nothing.
[Rennie]
You are now quickest by two tenths.
[Daniel] Okay.
[Croft] Sebastian Vettel has taken
front row at the moment as we go on.
[Brundle] This is gonna be so close.
[Croft] Daniel Ricciardo, he was on pole,
of course, here in 2016,
crosses the line
now you're going to the one-tens.
What a lap!
Pole by a country mile.
[Daniel]  Whoo hoo!
[Rennie] And that is pole position.
Nice job, mate.
[Daniel] Fuck, yes!
Delighted for the pole,
but we should've had two cars up there,
and, uh... it's frustrating to not have
both cars on the front row of the grid.
[Daniel] All right, that's 50% done.
Let's finish this shit tomorrow.
Until I lift that trophy
and feel that weight,
um, I won't be completely satisfied.
[applause]
[cheering]
I don't think Daniel's putting
a foot wrong at the moment.
If the team have got
question marks in anybody,
it's why they've spent
so much money on Max.
Max put it in the wall
trying to prove to the world
that he was quicker than Daniel.
And he sacrificed his entire weekend
for what? For nothing.
Daniel is starting to stand out
as the more consistent
and the more stable option
that Red Bull have got.
So if Daniel then delivers again here
and Max misses
another opportunity to win,
you wonder if doubts will creep in
at Red Bull about whether
they've put their money
behind the right driver at this stage.
[reporter] In percentage terms,
how confident are you of keeping him?
Um, it's always difficult
to put a number on these things,
but we're very, very happy with Daniel.
He does a great job in the team.
He's a popular member in the team,
and there's a desire for us
to retain him for next year.
[Croft] This is what it's all about
when it comes to motor racing.
There is one place to be today,
and that is here in Monte Carlo.
Daniel Ricciardo in pole position.
Sebastian Vettel in second.
And because of his disaster in qualifying,
Max Verstappen will start
right at the back in last place.
Max, how are you doing this morning?
-Not so good.
-[laughing]
[Claire] If we could get points
on one car,
that would be a great achievement,
but if we could get both cars,
even better.
If there was a huge great pileup
at the start of the race
and our cars just went through,
one can only dream, can't you?
Ten less than P3.
[Daniel] The waiting sucks.
I just want this race to start already.
I feel, this year, with the car we've got,
you know, since 2016,
it's my best chance to win.
Basically the win was taken from me
through no fault of my own.
Got the first pole position of my career.
I had a comfortable lead.
[Croft] Daniel Ricciardo is looking
set to win the Monaco Grand Prix.
[Rennie] Okay, Dan, now box this lap,
please. Box this lap.
[Daniel] The team called me in,
and I come in the pits,
and there's no tires there.
[men yelling indistinctly]
[Daniel] And it's like a shit show.
[Brundle] They haven't got
the tires ready. The tires aren't ready.
[Daniel] The pit stop, instead of being
three seconds, it was more than ten.
[Croft] Ricciardo is sat there, waiting.
[Daniel] I come out the pits,
and literally see Lewis just come past me.
[Croft] Hamilton now leads
after a pit-stop that saw
Daniel Ricciardo sat stranded
waiting for his tires.
[Daniel] So, I lost the race.
Right now, I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear anything. I, uh...
I want to get out of here, to be honest.
This one hurts a lot.
[Daniel] 2018. This is my time.
It's my fucking time.
If he can go and win this race
and beat Max,
that tells Red Bull that they need
to put their faith in him,
but that might not be his main priority.
He might think, "I need to show myself
as a great opportunity for another team,
a Mercedes or a Ferrari."
[Croft] The 2018 Monaco Grand Prix.
[Brundle] It is time to get down
to the serious business.
[commentator] As we count down
towards the start of this race...
[Brundle] The driver can make
the difference around this track.
[Croft] The story so far, Daniel Ricciardo
in the Red Bull,
has dominated the whole weekend.
Every single practice session,
every single qualifying.
Verstappen had the chance for pole,
but it's 20th and last for the Dutchman.
What can Ricciardo do
from the front of the grid?
[Brundle] Will good fortune shine
on Williams
with Lance Stroll in 17th place?
The grid is cleared in Monaco
with Daniel Ricciardo on pole position.
[Croft] It's a tense moment
as the lights go on.
[engines roar]
[Brundle] Vettel is trying to attack
into turn one!
But he's not quite close enough.
Ricciardo leading, but Vettel is
very, very close to the back of him.
[Rennie]
The gap behind to Vettel, one point one.
[Daniel]
So far everything feels all right.
[Croft] Max Verstappen's already gone past
Grosjean and Magnussen.
Is he gonna try and launch one?
He is, down the inside. On Lance Stroll.
-[engineer] Nice move, Max. Well done.
-[Max] Yep.
[Brundle] With this pace, he can just
keep picking these off one by one.
[Croft] Lance Stroll
fighting with Leclerc.
Oh, a bit of contact.
[crowd cheering]
[Lance] What's the problem with the car?
Something happened.
[Urwin] I think the front wing is damaged.
[Croft] And so it's a front wing change
and the tires.
[Rennie] Daniel, you're doing
a really good job, mate.
That's really good stuff.
You just need to keep it smooth.
[Daniel] I got it, buddy.
[Croft] Ricciardo still leading
Sebastian Vettel.
And box, Daniel, Box. Box.
Box this lap.
[Brundle] Remember the pit-stop
that cost him victory here in 2016.
[tools whirring]
[Daniel] Yes, boys.
[Brundle] Ricciardo relieved
that that pit-stop went okay.
[Croft] Yeah, no problems
this time around for Daniel Ricciardo.
He's still smiling this afternoon.
[cheering]
[Rennie] Let's keep it focused, mate.
Keep it focused.
[Croft] Verstappen gets
a really good exit. He's gonna go for it.
Of course he is. He's Max Verstappen.
[Max] Yes! Whoo!
[Verstappen laughing]
[Croft] Verstappen moves up
into ninth place.
[Vettel] Ricciardo seems
to have a problem.
[Croft] And you can see it,
slowing down dramatically.
[Brundle] I see trouble brewing.
[Daniel] I'm losing power.
Let me know if I can do something.
[Rennie] Fail one fail. Fail one fail.
[Croft]
This could totally change the race.
[Daniel] Will it get better?
[Rennie] Negative, Daniel. Negative.
[Horner] The MGU-K failed.
That usually means the engine is screwed
and it's 99% you have to retire the car.
[Croft] The minute Daniel Ricciardo
makes a mistake,
Sebastian Vettel is all over him.
[Daniel] This is like a moment of defeat.
A moment of helplessness.
Part of you just wants to rip
the steering wheel off and just throw it.
How is this happening?
[Croft] How long can Daniel Ricciardo
keep Sebastian Vettel behind him?
Can he keep him behind him?
[Rennie] I know it's hard,
but keep it focused.
[Daniel] Yeah, I got no power though.
[Croft] To finish first,
first you have to finish.
Lance Stroll is two laps
behind the race leader now.
[Lance] The brake pedal's
going really, really long.
[Baldisserri] Concentrate on turn 19.
[Lance] I don't understand.
It's ridiculous.
What's the point in even racing now?
[Brundle] Stroll's just struggled
with the car all weekend long.
[Croft] I tell you what,
it never rains, but it pours.
For Williams at the moment,
it is pouring.
[Brundle] Vettel now pushing harder.
[Rennie]
Ten laps of focus. Ten laps to go.
[Croft] This problem that
Daniel Ricciardo's had for so, so long
is still being managed.
[Horner] It was just totally intense,
because he couldn't get beyond sixth gear,
'cause there just wasn't the power.
[Croft] You gotta feel for him
in that cockpit at the moment.
His nerves are gonna be
shredded to pieces.
[Vittel's engineer]
Keep putting pressure. You're doing well.
Head down till the end.
He will make a mistake.
[Daniel] It's out of your control.
But then you think, if I start playing
the sad story, then it's not gonna help.
[Rennie]
There are three laps to go.
Daniel, you're doing
a really good job, mate.
Very impressive.
[Horner] I'm thinking, "We're leading
the Monaco Grand Prix.
I don't care if this engine goes bang."
[Daniel] Yeah, we can win it.
So, let's fucking win it.
[tires squealing]
[Brundle] It's a big lockup for Vettel.
Can he get it stopped?
Just about.
Stoffel Vandoorne isn't
in the battle for the lead,
but he's come out between
the two leaders after his pit-stop.
[Vettel] Is this believable
what this guy is doing?
[Croft] I would imagine Ricciardo
is starting to smile
just that little bit more.
Ricciardo starts his final lap.
[Brundle] You can't deny,
he really does deserve it this weekend.
[crowd cheering]
[Croft] Today at Monte Carlo,
it's redemption day for Daniel Ricciardo.
[Daniel laughing]
[Horner]
Daniel Ricciardo, you are our hero.
Un-fucking-believable.
Yes!
[cheering]
[Horner] To see your car and driver
cross the line first
is like no other feeling in the world.
[cheering]
[Claire] It's very difficult to come
to terms with when you're not winning.
We haven't won a race now
for nearly six years.
That's a long time.
[distant cheering]
When should I go,
"Actually, do you know what?
Maybe I'm not the right person to do this.
Am I good enough to do it?
Do I have the capability?"
[crowd yelling]
[cheering loudly]
[Daniel] There they are. Wanna hold it?
[laughing]
Oh, here you go.
Wow.
[Horner] It's the most
proudest parents in town.
-Oh!
-[Horner laughs]
-Oh, well done, you.
-Thanks, mate.
-Oh, you did. He did. He did.
-[Horner] That was class.
I'm not sure whether the price
has gone down or up.
[both laughing]
-Amazing. Amazing.
-Unbelievable.
[Horner] He did
an unbelievable job today, eh?
[cheeering]
Well, you know, it's just really painful.
[Horner] It'll come.
You know. So, be happy
for your teammate today.
-Yeah, yeah, sure.
-[Horner] Celebrate with him.
You know how this business is.
-It's up and down.
-Yeah.
[cheering]
[cameras clicking]
[Max]
I should have won that race,
and seeing the whole team happy,
it's hard.
Because you're standing there,
you have to try and smile and be happy,
'cause the whole team's happy, but--
Yeah, for me, it was definitely
the worst moment
and I was really not happy.
I could literally...
break down
the whole Energy Station by myself.
[Grace] I was so thrilled,
because I knew what it meant to him.
Yeah.
It was the best.
[crew] Yeah!
[Daniel] I want to be
the best in the world,
and I believe I've got the talent
and I've put in the work.
Without getting arrogant,
certainly gonna have some--
some serious offers on the table.
Yeah!
[Abiteboul] Comments from Red Bull
involving the engine
has been a step too far.
The red line crossed.
[Horner] That is a big, big issue.
We've been paying to fly in first class,
but ended up with an economy ticket.
[Abiteboul]
We need to see that people respect us.
[Horner] The relationship
with Cyril's been difficult.
[Abiteboul] Every single race win
that Red Bull had was with Renault.
[Horner] He's an emotional guy.
You never know what you're gonna get.
[Abiteboul] Crunch time.
[Croft] And it means a lot
to be racing against Red Bull.
[Horner] We need to make a decision.because of the amount
of sniping and biting.
It's much worse than swimming with sharks.
[Horner] There's
so much money involved in the sport.
It is not just about
what you see at a Grand Prix track.
It's what goes on behind the scenes.
Absolutely cutthroat.
If you want to be strong on the track,
you also need to be strong off track.
[Haas] Success in racing
comes down to just being stubborn.
A lot of your competitors
will fall apart before you will.
[Brown] Politics are a big part
of the sport. It can get pretty nasty.
[Horner] There's a lot of posturing,
positioning, total paranoia.
[Abiteboul] You always want
to destabilize your competitors.
If you can't take the heat,
stay out of the kitchen.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[engine roars]
This is, albeit a short one, the history
of the team, the championship years.
Winning four championships.
Max's first victory.
Daniel's first victory.
What we've actually done in
the last 15 years is pretty significant.
You know, this was our first winner.
This was the first
Driver's Championship car.
It was the first
Constructor's Championship car.
Great job, Sebastian.
Proud of you. Great job.
To take on all the great teams
at that time, you know, really,
the start of a totally dominant period
for Red Bull Racing.
We're an energy drinks manufacturer.
We're the maverick in Formula One.
We've won eight World Championships.
But in the last few years,
we've lagged behind.
We need to challenge the big teams.
Our Achilles' heel has been the engine.
[Croft] And it is
absolute double disaster for Red Bull.
[Brundle]
Both have just plain broken down.
[Horner] And that's been
immensely frustrating for us.
We have to raise our game.
You know that the good thing
about Renault in Formula One...
I think that, obviously,
the only possibility to live in Paris
and work in Formula One,
which is not that bad.
[Abiteboul] We are French.
We are passionate.
[indistinct chatter]
Renault is a partly state-owned company,
so it really belongs to the French people.
This position in which I am currently,
it's a huge privilege.
Come in. Go on, go on, go on.
Lunch is part of life, so...
It's a very important part of life.
Thank you.
We are a French team.
We have the best table in the paddock.
And it has to be the same at the factory.
[engine revs]
Renault is one of the few teams
that make a Formula One engine.
We also happen to supply
those engines to other teams.
Getting a Formula One engine right
is very complicated,
because we are talking
about many components.
Engine technology is very complex.
We also happen
to supply those engines to Red Bull.
It's a customer, but at the same time,
they're our competitors.
[Horner]
We at Red Bull, we don't make road cars.
We're not an engine manufacturer.
We've bought our engines from Renault
for the past twelve seasons.
We pay for the service
that Renault provide...
but we're not consulted on any decisions
that are made regarding the layout,
the cooling, the exhaust,
the integration of the engine
into the chassis.
We have to accept
whatever Renault want to do.
And that is a big, big issue.
Starting to have very strong comments
from Christian regarding performance.
[Abiteboul] It is very clear
that the relationship with Red Bull
is going to a crunch time.
But the engine is progressing.
It's capable of winning races.
Every single race win that Red Bull had
was with Renault.
We've had a love-hate relationship
with Renault for the last twelve years.
You know, Renault have fallen behind
their rivals in Ferrari and Mercedes,
and, you know, that's caused frustration,
friction in the relationship, tension.
[Abiteboul]
He's clearly someone who wants to control
every single element of this car.
But unfortunately, he has to accept
that there is one element
they're not controlling.
[Horner] With that engine supply,
we've been paying to fly in first class,
but ended up with an economy ticket.
Bang-for-buck value for money
is crucial to us.
And it's a very, very important year
for the team,
so we need to make a decision.

[woman laughs]
[cheering]
[Daniel]
I've been with Red Bull since 2008.
Now that contract is coming
to an end this year, and...
when it comes to looking ahead,
you've kind of gotta see who's doing what.
You gotta try and figure out
who's gonna dominate
for the next, you know,
one to three years.
[cheering]
[emcee] Welcome, Daniel Ricciardo
and Max Verstappen!
[cheering]
A nice birthday present.
Shoe size, 58.
[Daniel] The main thing for me
is to put myself
in the best car with a chance to win
to try and see
if I'm the best in the world
and show what I believe I've got.
Where I am in my career--
I'm 29 now. If I'm ever, ever gonna be
world champion,
making this decision is massive.
[emcee] One more time,
Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen.
[cheering]
-[Horner] Anything I need to be aware of?
-[crew] Um...
Daniel was positive?
-He said discussions had moved on.
-Yeah.
-The next couple of weeks...
-Yeah.
...he would hope to be giving an answer.
-Basically, before the summer break.
-Okay, good. Super.
[crew] Yeah.
Let's go here.
You couldn't see any reason why Daniel
wouldn't re-sign with you guys?
That you were confident that he would.
Feeling more confident this week?
We're very happy with Daniel.
We hope that we retain him in the team.
He's in a great car.
He's a championship contender this year.
I can't imagine him anywhere else.
[Abiteboul in French] Hello.
Hi, how are you?
Hello.
[Abiteboul in Enlgish]
We are currently fourth in championship,
and Red Bull are third.
Red Bull is obviously a great brand...
uh, but to drink.
Renault is one
of the largest car makers in the world.
We are here for building
the reputation of our brand.
It's all about playing catch up
against Red Bull.
[Horner] We have impatient shareholders,
impatient sponsors, impatient drivers.
The Renault team cannot outperform us.
[Daniel] Teammates...
we've been super competitive.
Naturally, with that,
there becomes a competition, a rivalry...
a lot of friction, tension.
[Verstappen]
My teammate, but also my biggest rival.
I need to be the faster driver of the two.
I hate to lose.
[Daniel] All this contract talk,
it does put more pressure on me.
When it comes to these negotiations,
to strengthen your position,
winning is important.
-Have a good one.
-Thanks.
Get your head down.
[cheering]
[Buxton] Now only moments away
from the start of the Austrian Grand Prix.
-[Rennie] Radio check, please.
-[Daniel] Yep, Rennie, that's good.
-Things should happen today.
-[engine revs]
[Buxton] Ricciardo needs
his third win of the season here
to stay in contention
for the championship.
[engine revs]
[Croft] Verstappen has started well!
Daniel Ricciardo is trying
to get past Grosjean.
And he's up into fifth!
Renault also battling through the pack.
Carlos Sainz,
oh, bit of a collision there.
Oh, now his teammate Nico Hülkenberg
has a major problem.
[Hülkenberg]
Loss of power. I've lost power.
[Joyce] Stop the car, please, Nicky.
You've got fire at the back of the car.
And that's game over.
[Buxton] Appears to be
an engine issue for Renault.
[announcer 2]
Ricciardo, closing up on Kimi Räikkönen.
[Rennie] Good move, mate. Nice job.
[Croft] And up into third place now.
[Daniel] Okay, so, Hamilton is only
18 seconds ahead.
[Daniel] Okay.
[Buxton] Into the pit lane,
Lewis Hamilton for Mercedes,
currently in the lead,
but now he's in for his tire change.
[Rennie] Hamilton is in the pit lane.
So, push now. Push on if you can.
[Croft] Now will Ricciardo
be able to overtake Hamilton
as he comes from the pit lane?
-[Rennie] Gonna be close. Gonna be close.
-[Daniel] Okay.
[Rennie] Hamilton one second behind you.
[Croft] Red Bull suddenly smell
a victory here today.
[all] Oh!
[Croft] What was that coming out
of the back of the Red Bull?
[Daniel] Losing gear sync.
[Rennie] Fail. Two fail, Daniel.
We have got an issue.
[Daniel] It's the rear.
It's getting really bad now.
[Rennie] Okay. Fail. Two fail.
We're gonna have to retire, Daniel.
Retire.
[Croft]
Oh, he's got a problem. He's stopping!
Daniel Ricciardo is out of the race.
[Rennie] If you can,
pull over at turn one, please.
Pull over at turn one.
I'll tell you later,
but we've got some issues
at the rear end of the car.
Sorry about that, mate.
[Croft] Red Bull will not enjoy
the sights of a mechanical problem.
He is out of the Austrian Grand Prix.
Oh, dear. What a shame
for Daniel Ricciardo.
[announcer] That's blown the candles out
on the birthday cake.
[Buxton]
It's been a bad day for Renault.
Their sole remaining car finishes
in twelfth place with no points.
[Daniel] I know what I'm capable of,
but things seem to keep happening
out of my control. It's frustrating.
♪ Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you ♪
[Horner]
Do you know what day Max is in this week?
'Cause I wouldn't mind finding
half an hour with him
just in the afternoon.
Cool. All right.
-[woman] Okay.
-Okay. Speak to you later.
-Speak to you later.
-Thanks. Bye-bye.
[Horner] Daniel's contract talks
and discussions have made progress.
The only question that Daniel has,
quite openly is,
is the power unit going
to be able to compete with Mercedes
and Ferrari next year?
That is his only question,
in terms of the team's capabilities.
The only question over our package
for next year is the engine.
I have complete confidence that we can
become the best on the engine side.
Red Bull criticizing its supplier
is absolutely nothing new.
In a few weeks, we will not be
in a position to guarantee supply
to Red Bull anymore.
We need to order parts from the suppliers
to build the engine for next year.
I can't postpone forever--
forever the deadline.
So, if Red Bull Racing wants
to be supplied by Renault,
they need to let us know
as quickly as possible.
[Horner]
What is the best route to competitiveness?
Is it to stay with Renault?
Or is it to move to another manufacturer?
One that would allow us to have
an input into the design of the engine
to create true harmony
between engine and chassis.
It's so crucial
we make the right decision.
[Horner] At eight a.m. tomorrow morning,
we'll be announcing
we will not be continuing
our relationship with Renault.
[reporter]
We have got a breaking new story...
Christian Horner
is dumping Renault next season.
[reporter 2] Renault would stop
supplying Red Bull from 2019...
That's millions of dollars Renault
will no longer be receiving next year.
A blow to the Renault brand, as one less
team has a Renault engine next year.
[reporter] I'm in a bit of disbelief,
to be honest.
He lost faith.
[indistinct chatter]
[man] Yeah...
[Horner] Who else is in the conference?
-They've got Cyril...
-[Horner] Great.
[indistinct chatter]
-How are you?
-Yeah, could be better.
-Are all your bigwigs here this weekend?
-A few of them, yeah.
-I'm sure.
-[laughs]
[cameras clicking]
You know, we've decided to take
a different path for next year.
We've been following the progress
of Honda's development very closely.
And the decision we've made
is that Honda is absolutely
the right route for Red Bull.
We're all selfish in this business.
Renault's priorities are--
obviously are their own team.
From 2019, we won't be paying
the amounts we've been paying to Renault.
It's exciting news for us.
2019, we're looking forward to it.
Cyril, can we get Renault's feelings
on the news from this week?
Yeah, well, the implication
of, uh, the termination of the deal
on our budget is really marginal.
Uh... yes, there was a substantial revenue
associated to that supply,
but there were
also substantial costs associated.
And clearly marginal in comparison
to a view of our budget
of our organization, as we speak.
-[man] Thank you, bye-bye.
-[Horner] That was juicy, wasn't it?
[Buxton] Now, you guys and Red Bull...
shall we say it's not been the happiest
of marriages for the last few years?
Sort of a marriage where you're hanging
around for the sake of the children,
rather than because you're
in love with each other.
The Honda route is the best route forward
for us for the future.
Personally, I'm a bit sad,
because it's been twelve years or so
of my life, dealing with Christian...
No, Renault was very keen
to have us.
They were desperate even till last week.
We feel now that we don't
need Red Bull anymore.
We're still relying on Renault
in our current season.
How can you promise them
that the performance level
will be as high as possible?
And how has this news been received
by Daniel Ricciardo?
I think he sees the logic, the data
that we're looking at.
It's a no-brainer.
So, it boosts your chances
of retaining him.
I would think so, absolutely.
-[Abiteboul] There you go.
-[reporter] Thank you very much.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
I think that was all right.
Very entertaining.
[Daniel]
I need another excuse for a tattoo,
so I really wanna win a championship soon
so I can get something to represent that.
[laughs]
All this contract talk, it's--
Winning is still the main thing for me.
At least top of my list,
it's be somewhere where I can win.
But I-- Maybe it comes with age,
but it needs to be a happy environment...
to be able to win.
So, um... stay, change,
stick with what we know,
it's all that sort of concoction
of emotions, isn't it?
-It's a big decision.
-Yeah.
I turn thirty next year.
I'm getting old, so...
[Beavis] We're in the privileged position
of having more than one option.
Having interest
from other really good teams.
Yeah, it's just about making
the correct overall choice.
[Beavis] We were both personally surprised
when Max announced that he'd extended.
Their focus looked like Max,
and he should be
the youngest ever world champion.
Those things aren't lost on us.
[Buxton] Welcome to the last Grand Prix
before a three-week summer break.
The drivers and their teams
are getting ready at the Hungaroring.
[Horner] The relationship
with Cyril's been difficult.
He's an emotional guy.
You never know what you're gonna get.
Comments involving the engine has been
a step too far from Red Bull.
The red line crossed.
[Croft] We are racing in Budapest.
Verstappen immediately
from seventh up to fifth.
Oh! Ricciardo!
[all] Oh!
[Croft] Ericsson just careered
into the side of Ricciardo there.
-[Rennie] Daniel...
-[Ricciardo] I dunno if there's damage.
-[Rennie] Stay out for now. Stay out.
-Okay.
[Croft] Sergio Perez going past as well.
[Daniel] Fucking Force India passed me.
There's no way he keeps that spot.
[Rennie] Okay, get focused.
[Rennie] Daniel, let's get going.
We are staying out. Stay out. Let's go.
-Understood.
-[Rennie] You know what to do.
[Daniel] Okay.
[Croft] Daniel Ricciardo, with
a little bit of damage from the start,
now down in sixteenth.
It's very difficult to overtake
on the Hungaroring.
Ricciardo is making a move
and he's got past Perez.
Next up is Vandoorne.
Past Vandoorne.
Ricciardo ducking and weaving.
And he breezes past Fernando Alonso.
Ricciardo really is one of
the best overtakers in the business.
-[Rennie] Next one ahead... Hülkenberg.
-[Daniel] Okay.
[Croft] Ricciardo now has
two Renaults to overtake.
The first is Nico Hülkenberg.
Oh, and that is spectacular stuff.
Super late on the brakes!
Next one, Carlos Sainz.
And Sainz becomes yet another victim
of Ricciardo in the first corner.
Ricciardo now up to seventh. Phenomenal.
Oh, there's a problem!
[crew groans]
-[Lambiase] Mate, no power, no power.
-[Verstappen] Yep. Mode one.
[Croft] Max Verstappen
in a nightmare weekend.
[Rennie] Stop the car, please,
on track, Max.
[Verstappen] I don't fucking care
if this blows up.
-[Rennie] Okay.
-[Verstappen] Fuck it!
[Rennie] Stop the car, please.
[Croft] Another power-issue-related
problem for Red Bull.
Piece of shit!
[Verstappen] Fuck! What a fucking joke
all the fucking time
with this shit, honestly.
[Verstappen groans]
[Rennie] Okay, Daniel, that last lap,
you were the quickest on track.
[Daniel] Yes.
[Croft] Ricciardo is flying.
All over the back of Kevin Magnussen
in the Haas.
Ricciardo's trying to go
the long way round.
And he's pulled it off!
Another great move!
Here's another place for Ricciardo.
He's fought back from sixteenth
up to fifth, very impressive.
Valtteri Bottas now ahead of him.
Bottas covers the inside.
Ricciardo has to go
the long way around.
Oh! And they touch!
Contact between Bottas and Ricciardo.
Bottas just careered into the side
of the Australian.
There's massive damage
on the side of that Red Bull.
[Rennie] Bottas just locked up
and went into you.
-[Daniel] Yes.
-You are now starting the last lap.
-[Daniel] Okay.
-[Rennie] You can still get him.
[Croft] Ricciardo goes for it again.
And he overtakes Bottas.
[camera clicking]
[Croft] With all that chaos behind,
it's been an easy race for Lewis Hamilton.
A commanding victory
for Hamilton and Mercedes,
winning the Hungarian Grand Prix.
Ricciardo recovers to fourth place.
[cheering]
[Rennie] Well done, Daniel.
Very strong drive.
-Some fantastic passing moves there.
-[Daniel] Cheers, guys.
[Daniel] It's just a good feeling
when you've done your best,
knowing that I've still got it
and proving it to people.
[Buxton] Renault disappointing
in ninth and twelfth.
And now over a hundred points
behind Red Bull in the championship.
[Abiteboul] We know
that the second part of the season's
going to be extremely intense...
Very tight against cars around us,
which right now are more competitive
and we need to change
the way that we are doing things
if we want to have any chance
to fight against them.
We had a good meeting last week,
and I'm pleased to announce to you
that we will have an increase
in the financial support
from next year
that we materialize in an extra budget.
[Abiteboul] We have a strategy.
We have a plan.
We need to see that people respect us.
We are not going to be intimidated,
full stop.
[Daniel] I've been on holiday
for two weeks.
So, I've been training the last few days,
getting back into it.
I just thought about a lot of things
this year and contract talks.
What am I gonna do next?
Red Bull's confident that next year
it's gonna be great.
But Honda, they haven't yet
proven themselves.
I don't know.
It's busy. It's been busy
for several months.
[Beavis] Without Red Bull, Daniel
would not be in the position he is now.
There is a significant
amount of loyalty there.
You have to be respectful of that.
[gunshots]
[laughing]
-How's the season?
-Good.
-Yeah?
-Good, yeah.
-Bits we could have been better, but...
-Yeah.
Yeah, we're nine races in.
We've won three of them.
[Horner] This is the best driver pairing
that we've had in our history.
Daniel's contract's
been talked about since preseason.
And I'm confident that we'll manage
to get things resolved.
[Horner] I've thoroughly enjoyed watching
his development the last ten years.
He's come through the ranks,
as a member of the junior program.
As soon as he got into
a Red Bull car,
he never stopped overtaking people.
[cheering]
[Horner] Seven Grand Prix victories
and over twenty podiums,
all achieved in Red Bull racing cars.
Personally, I view him as a good friend.
[Daniel] I'm trying to negotiate terms
with Red Bull.
I feel I've been loyal up until now.
A deal with Red Bull, it's all in front
of me now, like, this is it.
All I've gotta do is sign
the piece of paper.
Okay.
Hmm.
What if I just break free
and-- and make a statement?
Red Bull, I've been there
since I was 18, I think.
Now I have a chance to be an adult
and walk into a team as an adult.
My heart's going.
[heartbeat]
[Daniel] I've decided to leave Red Bull
and I'll be joining Renault for 2019.
At times, I've found myself frustrated.
[laughing]
I just felt I needed something different.
I like new challenges
and kind of having a fresh start.
[reporter] Hang on a minute, Daniel
Ricciardo is not re-signing for Red Bull.
He's going to Renault.
Were they expecting it?
No, it definitely caught them out.
Nice morning.
-Maybe we will go the normal way.
-Yeah, do you wanna-- I was gonna say.
You can sneak, but we'll go...
Otherwise you sneak through the paddock--
-Yeah. Nah, I will.
-That's maybe not--
-Let's take it all on the chin.
-Yeah.
[indistinct chatter]
All right. Where is the conference?
The top end.
[cameras clicking]
Oh, it's not that crazy.
[cameras clicking]
[Horner] Cyril.
He needs a driver and an engine.
[laughs]
Yeah.
So have you got money
to spend on your engine,
-now you've spent it all on your driver?
-We've got plenty of money.
It's kind of weird.
Like, super weird.
Yeah.
There's a bit of an-- Is it--
What's the-- Airy?
-Eerie. Eerie.
-Eerie? Eerie atmosphere?
[laughs]
Did something else happen this morning
that I don't know about?
Well...
It's gonna be weird,
but somewhat exciting.
I think it's a good move.
I'm leaving sufficient space for Max.
[cameras clicking]
[reporter] A question for Christian.
Given the loss of Daniel,
it's obviously very significant.
Is there any added frustration
in losing him to an organization
of which you've been
very publicly critical?
Um...
Of course it was a surprise.
Having had everything in front of him,
that he wanted and had required,
financially, uh, et cetera, et cetera.
Well, I suppose
the whole process with Daniel,
so long as he's comfortable looking
at himself in the mirror
with the choices that he's made,
you have to respect that.
We've had random discussion,
jokes with Daniel since a while.
Uh, it would be hard to put
an exact date on the first joke
about this this type of switch.
Renault can afford pretty much anything.
Renault is the largest car maker
in Formula One, full stop.
He bought into the project
and made his decision.
[reporter] Thank you.
[Buxton] And the knock-on effects
of Ricciardo moving to Renault
means Carlos Sainz will lose his seat.
[man] Press conference.
We know what they're talking about.
Mmm...
[man] Um... you know what's gonna be
asked, so it's all straightforward.
Is there anything in particular you guys
don't want or want to say?
This year, I wanna do the best on track.
My focus is Spa this weekend.
Next weekend, my focus is Monza.
[woman] I want you to cry.
I want you to be really sad.
Kind of just say you're gonna
miss us so much.
[Sainz] Okay, I'll try.
[chuckles]
[Sainz in Spanish] Thank you.
-[man] See you. Bye!
-[woman] Bye!
[Sainz in Spanish] Later.
[Daniel]
Now, with Red Bull, it'll be awkward.
I'll expect to be isolated.
[Beavis] People are shocked
in some quarters by the decision.
But I think it comes down
to where you feel wanted.
We had a private meeting
with Renault,
and they walked us through
what was coming.
It really showed you
the might of a manufacturer.
Their ultimate goal, to be
a world-championship-winning team again,
and they have the pedigree for that.
[Horner]
Is he making the right career choice?
In the end, my assumption is
he was running from a fight.
That's the way it feels to me.
[Horner] Always look ahead.
Focus on going forwards,
not backwards.
Our goal is not just to beat Renault.
Our goal is to try and be world champions.
[LeClerc] It's a very dangerous sport,
and it will always be.
[Ericsson] Confidence level goes down
when you have a crash like that.
Jules Bianchi has died...
[reporter] This year, his godson, Charles
Leclerc, made his Formula One debut.
[Horner] The bigger teams are now
putting their faith in younger drivers.
[Croft] Wow, look at that.
-LeClerc round the outside!
-[LeClerc] Yes!
[Vasseur] For Marcus,
it's a little hard to take.
[Croft] LeClerc is right on his tail now.
I've always dreamed
to be part of Ferrari.
[Vasseur] Charles has a mission to do
what Jules should have done.Force India Formula One team
will rightfully occupy
a place on the podium.
I'm Vijay Mallya,
Team Principal
of Sahara Force India Formula One.
I have always been passionate
about cars and racing cars.
So to acquire a Formula One team,
it's like a dream come true.
Nobody ever thought
that there would be
an Indian Formula One team on the grid.
It was just too expensive.
And it seemed more like
a pipe dream than a real dream.
From where we started
to finish fourth, two years running,
there can be no greater satisfaction.
[Sergio Perez] We did it once again, guys!
Once again!
[Croft] Sergio Perez picks up
a very unlikely podium.
[announcer] Brilliant, Checo!
Absolutely brilliant.
[Mallya] Now there are constant rumors
about offers to buy the team,
but I've invested blood,
sweat and tears
into Force India.
So I'm fighting every step of the way.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[Buxton] Vijay's always been one of
Formula One's more colorful characters,
known as the king of good times.
But Force India's success has come
from making every penny work for them.
They're one of the most efficient outfits
in the sport.
When you look at Force India
and McLaren over the last few years,
they're completely mirror images
of one another,
because while Force India
has achieved so much with so little,
McLaren,
one of the biggest names in the sport,
seems to be achieving
so little with so much.
[Croft] Oh, not another problem
for McLaren...
[Vandoorne] I lost drive...
I need to park up.
-[Eric Bouiller] Copy, Stoffel, copy.
-[Vandoorne] I don't have the same power.
[Boullier] We can't fix it.
We can't fix it.
[Alonso] Mate, I have no brakes, no tires.
We are out of the points.
I will try to do whatever,
but I don't care too much.
[Brundle] Sounded like a driver who wants
to call it a day, didn't it?
[Croft] Fernando Alonso becomes
the first retirement of this Grand Prix.
And Zak Brown not happy.
Not where they expected
to be or want to be.
[reporter]
Eric, do you accept any responsibility
for the failings of this car?
And will you resign?
[chuckles]
Um, obviously, we are all responsible
for the car performance.
Uh, we are not where we want to be,
we are not happy where we are...
Do you expect still to be
in your job at Silverstone?
[scoffs]
Good morning, Fernando. How are you?
Good. Where are you?
So I wanted to let you know,
and we can chat about it further.
Uh, last night
I accepted, uh, Eric's resignation.
Lots of pressure on the team,
as we all know,
and he's been taking the brunt of it.
Obviously it's been a tough
three, four years for him,
and he felt, in order
for us to move forward
with all the pressure,
that it was best he stepped aside.
I think we got great people.
We're gonna recruit some people
and, you know, get the team, uh...
turned around
and make McLaren great again.
[Brown] I think Fernando's one of the best
drivers in the history of Formula One.
Two-time world champion,
won over thirty races,
recognized by many
to be the best driver in the world.
When you have a driver
of Fernando's caliber,
you wanna keep them
in your racing team.
At the top, there's
one guy responsible now
and you're talking to him.
So the the buck stops with me.
You're absolutely right.
[Brown] Yeah.
[Brown] Any time you're responsible
for a large organization,
that comes with a lot of pressure.
So I like that first question 'cause
it'll also suck up about five minutes.
Yeah. That's good.
How's your search
for a technical director going?
Nope. We've already had it.
So, let's get rid of that one.
[Brown] It's a huge responsibility.
If you can't cope with the pressure,
you can't take the heat,
get out of the kitchen.
Um, he's asked Zak to address
whether it was a voluntary resignation
by mutual agreement.
Yeah. It's inappropriate for me
to get into any details
-of the conversation that Eric and I had.
-Yeah. Those are private matters.
[Buxton]
Zak Brown hasn't come from a position
of running a big racing team,
so he's got a huge, huge job on his hands,
especially when you consider
he's got a two-time world champion
in Fernando Alonso,
who demands nothing but the best.
[Mallya] Force India
could never afford an Alonso
or a Lewis Hamilton or a Vettel.
It's not a one man show.
It's a team effort.
And I guess I hired the right guys.
I hired Otmar
as the Chief Operating Officer.
I think he shares
the same passion and ambition.
Drivers, we have Checo Perez.
He's a gutsy driver
and he's got great race craft.
Esteban Ocon,
here's a guy who's young,
he's passionate,
he's hungry, and he's got talent.
[announcer] Nice job, Esteban. Nice job.
[Mallya] I think he surprised us all
in his first full year in Formula One...
and did himself proud.
[in Itallian] Hi, Carlo.
We are here with Roberta.
[in English]
And she wanted to let you know
that she deserve a lot of present,
a lot of attention.
Oh, thank you, guys!
Yes!
The fact that the team is able
to compete and perform
at such a high level
is absolutely incredible...
especially when you consider
the personal difficulties
that Vijay Mallya's
been going through.
[reporter] Today, it's the fall from grace
of one of India's most high profile
businessmen, Vijay Mallya.
Prosecution has told the court
that Vijay Mallya avoided attempts
to repay loans to banks,
did not disclose assets,
allegedly diverted loan money
to motor racing.
The allegations are baseless,
unfounded, deliberate.
It doesn't look good
on your Formula One team,
does it, apart from anything else?
[cameras clicking]
[Mallya] Right now, I'm in forced exile.
I am absolutely not guilty
of any one of these preposterous charges.
That is the truth.
It can't be helpful to Force India
to have Vijay facing such difficulties.
And with the banks in India wanting
to get hold of him,
Vijay can't be seen
to be spending loads and loads of money
when other people are chasing him
for loads and loads of money.
There isn't that cash flow
to Force India anymore,
so it's going to be having
some form of impact.
I'm Esteban Ocon, 22 years old,
racing for Force India Formula One team.
[Ocon] Vijay, for sure
it's a tough situation...
for me, for the race team, at the track,
but I can't focus
on all those things.
My job is to stick in the race seat
and put the car as high as I can.
That's the only thing I can do
to help the team at the moment.
Nice view, huh?
[engine revs]
From the first race, basically, I'm here,
training hard
and just improving all the aspects.
Mentally, physically...
From my point of view,
here is the best way.
There is nothing except sport here.
No girls, no drinks, no distractions.
[chuckles]
[computer] Get ready. Go!
[Ocon] The last season,
it's been a very special season for me.
I was very happy with how I progressed,
to be the most successful season
of the team.
And that feeling,
I want to have it more and more.
When I was a kid, it was
a different life then than everyone else.
Tough times. Yeah, for sure.
My parents,
they don't have a lot of of money.
Well, my dad's, yeah, he's a mechanic.
It's really hard to describe the hours
he was doing, when I was going to sleep.
Sometimes he was working all night
and I still saw him in the morning
on the same thing.
My dad always was saying,
"I want a better life for you
than I had for me."
[in French] For me, it's everything.
Esteban is my whole life.
I'm still here today for him.
Esteban is my greatest pride.
That's my son.
[Ocon in English]
My dad had his workshop.
I've always been growing,
seeing engines, fuel, rubber, whatever.
I used to be there, you know, playing
with little cars and after that,
you know, I always wanted
to be a racing driver.
Silverstone is a tough track, of course,
because, you know,
it's very quick and very technical.
Okay. I have to close the eyes, though.
[chuckles]
[Ocon] I'm a very competitive guy,
you know. I want to be world champion.
I'm not gonna lift the throttle
until I get it.
Stay straight, DRS on,
turn one, flat out.
Turn two, 50 meters.
Down the gears. Low corner.
Have to get on the power.
Bumpy arrival through there.
Brake. Third gear.
Long, long left. Turn seven.
Up on the curb.
Back on the power.
Third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh.
On the curb.
Flat out for cross.
[Ocon] All the races give
the same amount of points,
but there are certain races
that you really want to do well.
Silverstone is very special
as a race for everybody.
Formula One is British.
It's a fantastic event, you know.
You have so many fans.
[Mallya] The passion here amongst
the British audience is just exceptional.
[Brown]
Silverstone is an iconic Grand Prix.
It's a great circuit.
It is one of the core Grand Prix
that you wanna have success at.
[Alonso]
Silverstone is always one of the races
that we all want to win one day.
A win in Silverstone
makes you feel part of Formula One.
Difficult to explain by words,
but when you are driving
and when you are the paddock...
you know, it's the place to be.
It's the home of Formula One.
It feels special, 'cause it's home
and it's the one race of the year
you can drive from your house to.
I got your note... this afternoon.
I've gotta do the...
FIA and--
You're important,
but you're not morning important.
You're more, like, afternoon important.
[chuckles]
[reporter] Why Eric Boullier was not
the right guy to make McLaren great again?
These look like appointments which
have been made on the instruction of
or with the intention
of pleasing Fernando above anything else.
Is that fair or unfair?
Oh, it's totally inaccurate.
Some things, maybe,
I tried to, you know, give my feedback.
The most important thing is
to improve the car
and to be more competitive
and, you know,
hopefully from this weekend,
we see a step forward.
There is a feeling in the paddock that
Fernando's influence over McLaren
is all-telling and all-important.
You know, people will whisper--
Well, it used to be a whisper.
It's not even a whisper anymore...
that, you know,
it's sort of Team Fernando,
um... that he's making the decisions.
And everyone'll be wondering, what have
you done to your hand? Are you all right?
Yes. Super.
You haven't been punching
the wall again?
-Not yet. [chuckles]
-Thanks, Fernando.
[reporter] What do you like the most
about the track, which is legendary?
The fast corners.
To drive here in a Formula One car is--
It's experience that... you don't get it
in many other tracks.
Uh, this is very special.
-[reporter] Thank you. Good luck.
-Thank you.
[reporter] Thank you, Checo.
[in Spanish] Thank you.
What are your thoughts Checo,
on all the shit
that's going on
with McLaren at the moment?
-Ooh, difficult, no?
-[chuckles]
They are putting in all the people
that Fernando likes and that like him.
For me, it can be an option,
that he could become
a sort of owner of the team.
That's what happens
when  a driver controls so much.
How do you do? Hi.
-How do you do? Hi.
-[man] Nice to meet you.
[Mallya] I am the subject
of one of the greatest
political witch-hunts in Indian history.
Things are flying at me fast and furious.
And I don't know what
the government is going to do next.
[Medland] It clearly seems to be getting
more serious behind the scenes.
Vijay's unable to leave the UK
for fear of being arrested,
so the British Grand Prix is the only race
that Vijay can actually physically attend
to watch his own team.
Take care.
But he doesn't want
to give up Force India.
-Hi, Vijay.
-[Medland] It's his pride and joy.
[reporter] Question to Vijay.
There has been renewed speculation
about your future ownership
of Force India.
How do you respond to that speculation,
the team is for sale?
In your question you said,
"Renewed speculation," right?
People have been writing
about the ownership of my team
for years now.
I'm sure you will not see anybody
in Force India, indeed myself,
walk around with a "for sale'' sign.
Speculation remains speculation.
[announcer] It's a Saturday,
and the final practice
before qualifying begins.
Silverstone is a brilliant track
with the fastest, most exhilarating
corners anywhere on the calendar.
[Croft] Hamilton is pushing hard!
Now, Vettel would love pole position
on British soil.
And here comes Brendon Hartley...
And a big crash there for the Toro Rosso.
-[man] Are you okay?
-[Hartley] Yeah. Suspension failure.
[Croft] And we thought we'd have
20 drivers going for pole today,
but we've got 19.
Here is Stoffel Vandoorne.
[crew] Is the car okay, Stoffel?
[Stoffel] Seriously, the car
is so tricky to drive.
[announcer] Stoffel Vandoorne
driving very aggressively.
Too much curb, I think, for Vandoorne,
who's damaged his car.
There's a bit of carbon fiber debris now
down at turn six.
Alonso, meanwhile,
is on his first timed lap of the session,
flying through Copse Corner.
[Alonso] Seriously,
we were losing time on the straights.
[crew] Okay, Fernando.
[announcer]
Thirteenth for Fernando Alonso.
Vandoorne in 17th place.
Maybe that bit of debris
came off the car
and lost him a lot of performance.
It's been a tough weekend
for him and McLaren.
[announcer] Now, here comes Esteban Ocon
in the Force India.
Struggling for traction a little bit
coming out of Village,
the tight right-hander,
but looked much neater
through turn four.
[crew]
Esteban, so you're totally clear ahead.
[Ocon] Yeah. Okay.
[Croft] He's picked up time, Ocon.
[Ocon] Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Nice one.
[announcer] Ocon will start tomorrow's
race in the front half of the grid,
with his teammate, Perez, just behind.
Both McLaren drivers are further back.
-Hi, Vijay.
-How are you?
Very good. Very good. And you?
Good.
You squeezed a lot out of that car
in qualy today.
[Ocon] Little bit makes
massive difference in the end.
[emcee] Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome your Force India drivers,
Esteban Ocon and Sergio Perez.
[cheering]
[crew] When during the weekend, if ever,
do you think the car's been right?
Um... I-- I feel
like we've always struggled...
going into qualifying.
As soon as the speed kind of scrubs off,
it's like driving on ice.
[Buxton] What's going wrong with McLaren?
There's a lot of politics involved.
There's a lot of money.
It's a lot of decisions that were taken...
that have
become very difficult to reverse.
And I think that's
what McLaren are struggling with.
[emcee] Who's got a really good question?
-Little kid here.
-[emcee] Can I have your hat?
You got it.
[cheering]
You know, we're sort of
running out of things to check.
Certainly all the suspension internals
are okay.
All the suspension externals.
There's nothing obvious to find.
Do you think that the ride
was any different in qualifying?
No.
Uh... any thoughts
on the roll stiffness change we made?
-No. No difference.
-[crew] Uh, okay.
[emcee] Three...
[crowd] Two, one, go!
I think we lost performance, as we know,
in the last couple of races.
Always Formula One car improves
with headwind, but this year's,
it seems that
it is a huge step worse in tailwind.
I know you were testing in Barcelona...
all the ideas, but...
we are in the middle of July,
and we didn't saw any of those.
So... need to speed up.
[emcee] Enjoy the race tomorrow.
It's coming home!
[Croft] Welcome along to round ten
of the Formula One World Championship
in front of a record crowd
of 140,000 people.
[Mallya] Every time I see
Sahara Force India Formula One
on the World Championship grid
with Ferrari, with Mercedes,
you know, it's a great sense of pride.
[Ocon] As a kid,
I was watching Formula One on TV,
and I was dreaming, you know,
about being there on the race track.
But now, as a driver, you can't say,
you know, "He's better than me."
You always think you are the best.
I think if you don't start thinking
like that, that's a loss already.
[Szafnauer] To be fourth
in the championship again,
Toro Rosso, Renault, McLaren,
you gotta beat them. That is the task.
[Ojjeh] I think this season
really revealed
that maybe we're not as good
as we thought we were.
We should be the best
of the rest right now,
and we're the worst of the rest right now,
which is not good.
Somebody's gotta be accountable.
And right now, it's Zak.
-I'd like to get some points today.
-Fernando's-- Yeah.
-Well, he's got a big chance.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Ojjeh] Ultimately, we're a Grand Prix
team that's been bred to win races,
so the pressure will be on
for on-track results.
[crew] Come on, boys.
[Mallya] When the lights come on,
the adrenaline is pumping...
and the heart certainly misses a beat.
[Croft] Away we go
at the British Grand Prix!
[announcer] Whoa!
Contact between Perez and Alonso.
Ooh.
[Brown] Yeah, I think
we got shoved off at the start.
[crew] I think he damaged the front wing.
[announcer] And Perez is off!
[crew]
Checo, give us feedback. Give us feedback.
[Perez] Yeah, someone hit me.
[crew]
How's the front wing? Did you hit tires?
[Perez] No, I think it's okay.
[Croft] Kimi Raikkonen
on the outside, Vettel from Bottas.
They touched!
Hamilton's gone round. He's crashed!
That is massive disappointment
for the British crowd.
[Perez] What's going through my mind
when I crash?
Avoid. Nothing else.
Choose a direction as quickly as possible
and yeah, try not to hit it.
[Croft] Fernando Alonso's picked up
a place on Kevin Magnussen.
[crew] Great work. Now though, Magnussen
is the car behind you. He could be quick.
[announcer]
Magnussen's coming back at Alonso.
They're going wheel-to-wheel.
[Alonso] What I see from Magnussen,
I never saw in my life.
He pushed me wide at turn seven,
ten, eleven, and turn twelve.
[crew] Understood, Fernando. Head down.
[Alonso] It's ridiculous.
Ridiculous!
[Croft] And someone's had
a big off as well.
Ooh.
-Who's that? Sainz.
-Sainz.
-Sainz!
-Sainz!
[crew] Sainz and Grosjean.
[laughing]
[chuckles]
[announcer]
Gunter must be absolutely ready
to put his fist through the wall.
[Croft] Now, Esteban Ocon,
Kevin Magnussen right behind him.
Oh, look who's in tenth and in the points,
Fernando Alonso right in there.
[Brundle] We could be in
for a massive 11-lap scrap now.
[Croft] Oh, Verstappen's off!
We have lost Verstappen,
Grosjean, Sainz, Ericcson,
Leclerc, and Hartley from this race.
Nico Hülkenberg is
about 1.7 seconds clear of Esteban Ocon.
Kevin Magnussen
is ahead of Fernando Alonso.
He's got DRS to attack him with.
[announcer] Alonso's not giving up.
He's back on the inside of Magnussen.
-[Alonso] Yes!
-Got him.
He's relentless, isn't he?
-He's a monster.
-Yeah.
[Croft] Alonso, Magnussen, Gasly,
Perez, all in a huge scrap there.
Alonso ahead of Magnussen.
Eighth place at the moment for McLaren.
[Ocon] Well, if you have someone
like Alonso behind you, for sure,
you know he's gonna try hard.
As soon as you do a little mistake,
he will try to get you.
I remember where I come from.
A lot of sacrifices.
So I'm not gonna let anything stop me.
You need to trust your skill,
trust the car and be one.
[Croft]
Ocon crosses the line ahead of Alonso.
[Ocon]
Awesome job, guys. Really good.
Really tough race, but good points.
We're really happy.
[crew] Great job, mate. Great job.
[Alonso] We could be finished sixth.
We were flying now.
What a shame.
[Brown] Any time
you haven't maximized the weekend
or you think maybe
you've left something on the table,
that can be frustrating, 'cause points,
especially right now for us,
are very hard to come by.
[Alonso] Eighth is--
is probably not enough
with the performance
we had in the car today.
[Brown] I would've like to achieved more,
but I think I can say that
about every Grand Prix so far this year.
[Ocon] Fantastic results, you know,
P-7. We are really happy with that.
It was very, very tough race.
Uh... I have to say, you know,
keeping Fernando and Kevin
in the back was not an easy task,
and we're improving,
so that's why I am smiling now.
[Mallya] It is always good to have
a double-points finish,
particularly at home in Silverstone.
I'm extremely proud of my entire team
and all my employees as well.
-How are you, big man?
-[Mallya] I'm good, and you?
Good to see you.
Very well, thank you. Welcome along.
[Mallya clears throat]
You still gonna be around
by the end of the season?
Why do you ask?
Well, I'm hoping you're not
leaving, that's why.
No, no. Absolutely not.
What you don't want is
for the guys back at the factory
thinking, "Shit, my job's under threat."
If the team's getting sold,
that's not fair on them.
No. I have a famous saying
that I have been saying for decades.
I will believe it when the fat lady sings.
[man] Okay.
Pensions.
We haven't paid 'em in forever.
[man 2] So if it all gets across...
all the pension stuff will be paid,
so that's all part of the employer stuff.
-You should come up to date.
-It'll get sorted through.
Good. Those are
the only questions they have.
-All the pension stuff will--
-Salaries and pension.
Yeah, yeah.
Is everyone here?
Good morning, everyone,
and, uh, thanks for coming.
As you know,
from what you saw in the press
and in the media that on Friday
there was a case in London.
I cannot answer so many questions.
Please, please.
And our team and company
has been put into administration.
Thank you very much. No further questions.
-Nothing! That's all.
-Force India in administration, sir--
Control of the company sits
with ourselves as administrators
whilst we try and find
a solution that gives you a future
with new owners or new investment.
I am not going to answer any questions.
I've been advised not to.
[man] I know that probably
the most pressing thing
that everyone will be wanting to know is,
are you going to get paid on Wednesday?
And the answer to that is, yes.
[Ocon]
When I heard the news that Vijay left,
of course it was difficult, you know,
because I'm--
Vijay, I was very close to him.
[Mallya] Thank you very much.
[Ocon] It's been one of the people
that picked me up in Force India,
basically in the beginning.
-I got myself one in my house.
-Oh, you practice now?
Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
[Ocon]
He had always been very nice to me,
and he used to send me a message,
you know, before the race.
"Yeah, Esteban, score points there.
Good luck, and I'm cheering for you."
And I will miss him definitely.
I will miss that passion for the sport,
but I think everyone in F1
wants Force India to keep racing.
The problem is that the last two teams
that this happened, they disappeared.
[Croft] Force India, that's the big story.
Could the team rise from the ashes
with Lawrence Stroll as the new boss
and his son as their driver?
[Lance]
I'm going into the family business.
[reporter] Who's going to be out
of a seat for next season? Perez or Ocon?
If you do a strong job on the team,
they can't skip you.
[Croft] Into the wall goes Esteban Ocon![reporter] The Force India Formula One
team has gone into administration,
following a court hearing in London.
Administration is there to provide
the opportunity to rescue and save.
So no one's giving up.
[clamoring]
The team needs real funding
to make sure it delivers
the potential that Otmar
says you can all deliver.
As long as we stay together,
we will find
the best possible financial solution
and ownership going forward.
-[cameras clicking]
-[clamoring]
[Croft] The future for Force India
has been dominating
the headlines over the summer,
The team has survived after
the administrators reached an agreement
with a consortium
of investors on a rescue package.
[Buxton] The consortium is led
by  billionaire businessman,
Lawrence Stroll...
-You looking for me?
-[reporter] Just the man.
[laughs]
[Buxton]
...father of 19-year-old Lance Stroll,
So, could Lance soon be driving
for his dad's new team?
[Lance]
For the moment, I'm here at Williams.
I'm not, uh, sure
what I'll be doing in the future.
Uh, we'll see what my father
decides to do with me.
He's a nice guy. I hope they'll take me.
[laughs]
[Medland] Lawrence Stroll buying the team
is always gonna want his son
to drive for it.
It's basically an open secret
that Lance will move across
and race at Force India.
Both drivers at the team,
Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon,
will be looking over their shoulder
wondering,
"Well, which one of us
is gonna get the chop?"
And historically,
those two have not got on.
-[Croft] Once again, they have touched.
-[Brundle] Crazy.
[Ocon] Guys, what the fuck
is this guy doing?
Fucking idiot.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[Croft] Welcome to Spa
for the Belgian Grand Prix.
It's an important race for the teams,
and none more so than Force India.
The pressure's on
to impress new boss Lawrence Stroll.
How long we gonna wait?
My name is Otmar Szafnauer,
and I'm the Chief Executive Officer
and Team Principal
of Racing Point Force India
Formula One team.
[grinding]
[Szafnauer] It would've been
a disaster disappearing mid-season.
So it was tricky times,
but we came out of it.
The team is pretty much unchanged:
same people, same car,
same desire to do well.
But Lance coming into the team
is probably what will happen,
and what it means now
is losing one of our drivers.
[Ocon] I know you know.
We are facing this unsure future.
It's a difficult situation for me.
[tools whirring]
As a kid, I always wanted
to be a racing driver.
There was nothing else.
I've been racing since
I'm seven years old.
[interviewer] How expensive is it to try
and get kids into F1?
Oof.
[chuckles]
Uh, it's difficult to tell you how
expensive it is exactly, but, um...
for sure, for someone normal,
like we were, it's--
Yeah, everyone was saying
it's impossible, basically.
My parents, they don't have a lot of money.
They sacrificed a lot.
We were living in a caravan
for a few years, so we could go to races.
[in French] It's still here?
[Ocon in English] Without my parents,
I would not be here for sure.
-[in French] She isn't coming?
-No.
[Buxton] Esteban's story is amazing.
He's come from nothing
to having the potential
to be not just a race winner,
but a championship contender.
But motor racing's a funny business.
Talent will get you so far,
but money has a massive role to play.
As a driver, if you come with a bevy
of sponsors who can add millions
to the pot that the team has
to design, to develop their car,
and have increased potential
to score points,
then the team
is gonna look favorably on you,
to take you onboard
as one of their drivers.
Hi, I'm Sergio Perez.
I drive for Force India.
I've been here eight years
in Formula One.
I'm 28 years old.
F1 was always my dream, to race
with the best drivers in the world.
I was always racing in Mexico
and I never thought that an opportunity
to race in Europe was going to come up.
It was always very expensive.
So we had to find sponsors.
Carlos Slim is one of
the richest guys in the world.
I remember calling him all the time
when I was a fourteen year old
to give me an opportunity.
We started together the dream
of making it into Formula One.
The career that I have, it's pretty much
linked to our decisions we took together.
[Buxton] Sergio's always had
a very strong hand at Force India
because he was the money guy.
He brought big sponsorships
from Mexico with him,
but now, there's a bigger fish,
and that bigger fish is Lawrence Stroll.
So Sergio's not king of the hill anymore.
It's anyone's guess,
at the moment, who gets that seat.
Esteban and Sergio...
I don't think they're
on each other's Christmas card list.
I think it's fair to say that.
Formula One is massively competitive,
but the situation
with Ocon and Perez in 2017
went beyond the point that I think
any of us thought that it would.
You've gotta understand the psychology
and the dynamics of the team,
and how that worked.
You know, Esteban had to quickly
make a name for himself.
He was a rookie.
Sergio, he had to assert himself
as the driver
that was with the team the longest.
[Brundle] This is two teammates
scrapping away here.
[Croft] Ocon is gonna go for it again,
trying to get past Perez,
but here comes Vettel in the Ferrari.
Up the inside into turn one,
Ocon slithers out wide.
And the two Force Indias,
after fighting each other,
have lost a place.
[Ocon] He moved at the last moment.
What is this?
It's not fair racing at all.
[Buxton] Esteban, did your teammate
cost you a chance
at your first Formula One podium today?
Uh, yeah. I think so, for sure.
But, that's racing, you know?
Um... and that's not gonna
take away my smile.
[Buxton] Are you racing
for Sergio Perez,
or are you racing for Force India?
[Perez] Oh, of course, I'm racing
for my team, you know?
I think I just defend the position
as I will do to anyone.
[Croft] The two Force Indias
vying for position.
Perez gets ahead of Ocon.
They come into the left-hander...
oh, they've made contact!
[Brundle] Big damage
to Perez's front wing.
[Croft] Both damaged.
[Perez] What did Esteban do, guys?
I think he was just over-aggressive.
I think, um, what happened today
is totally unacceptable for the team.
[Buxton] He says
that you gave him no room.
Says that you squeezed him against a wall,
cost the team a potential win today.
That's what he said? Okay.
Well, if that's what he said, you know,
I'm not gonna comment.
[Buxton] Both Sergio and Esteban,
they're both looking at their future.
So this inter-team rivalry
of being top dog at the team
becomes all encompassing...
[Croft] The two teammates
are battling again.
Perez gets past Ocon,
as they now accelerate
towards the fastest part of the circuit.
Oh! The two Force India's made contact!
Missing a part of his front wing,
Ocon there.
-Once again, they have touched.
-[Brundle] Crazy.
[Ocon] Guys, what the fuck?
What the fuck is this guy doing?
Front wing broken now.
[Croft] The two Force Indias
get too close together
and it is a puncture for Sergio Perez.
[reporter] Has the relationship
between you totally gone now?
I don't know. The thing for sure is
that I'm gonna go speak to him man-to-man
and tell him the truth, you know?
He's gonna have a child. I don't know
if he wants to die or something.
[reporter] It seems that you both get
locked into some huge battles on track.
-Is that good for the team?
-Yeah. No, not at all.
Especially after today.
But we have to look back,
remember Baku, you know?
He put me there on the wall.
I'm not saying that I did it
because of that, you know,
but tension starts back then, you know?
[Buxton] It got so bad,
the team stepped in
and stopped them from racing each other.
It was as simple as that.
They were not allowed
to race one another again.
Once they started understanding how
important it was for them to work together
and not crash into each other,
it got better.
[engines buzzing]
[Croft] It's time for qualifying
here in Spa.
[cheering]
Esteban Ocon and Sergio Perez
are used to fighting each other
for points,
but now, they're fighting for a seat.
Who can show what they're capable of
at one of the most challenging
and treacherous tracks in the world?
Rain in the air. It would be, it's Spa.
[Bradley Joyce] The worst of the rain,
we think has missed turn one.
It's raining heavy in the pit lane now.
The difference between driving on the wet
and the dry, every lap,
one line can be much quicker
than the other one.
So you have to adapt.
Every lap is different conditions.
This is what's fun about it.
[Croft] Lewis Hamilton going for a record
fifth pole position here at Spa.
[Hamilton] It's raining a lot
down the back here.
[Croft] The crowd are reaching
for the umbrellas already
and it might be that the track
is a bit too slippy.
[Buxton] At the speeds
these guys are doing,
when it starts to rain,
your reactions have to be lightning.
[tires squealing]
[Hamilton] Oh, shit. Valtteri's gone off.
[Croft] Valtteri Bottas has slid his way
off the track.
[Perez] Fucking shit, man! Fucking shit!
[Croft] They've got to get
on the right line.
They've got to spot every braking point.
And it's Hamilton
with the fastest lap-time so far.
[Hamilton] That was one tough lap to do.
[Croft] Sergio Perez
looks set to take fourth,
an amazing result for Force India,
if he can hang onto it.
-[Tim Wright] Checo, P-4. P-4.
-[Perez] Good job, guys.
[Croft] There are challenges still to come
for Esteban Ocon.
When I was a kid, there was a lot
of time spent on the rain.
And when all the kids were stopping
because it was too wet,
they were getting wet,
I was keeping going even when I had
freezing hands where I couldn't move.
I was crying after that.
But while driving,
I was not feeling anything.
I was pushing to be the best I could.
[Joyce] So, Esteban, that is...
P-3. P-3.
[Ocon] You're joking. You're joking.
[Croft] Ocon goes third fastest.
His best ever qualifying in Formula One.
[Ocon] Whoo!
Yes!
Whoo!
[Croft] The rain came down
to give Force India
one of their greatest ever days.
[Joyce] They're waiting for you
on the grid.
You need to line up in P-3,
which is to the left hand side.
It's Hamilton, Vettel, you.
[Ocon] Oh, my God.
[Buxton] Esteban Ocon's
qualifying performance in Spa
was absolutely astonishing.
You'd think that he qualified
above everybody,
other than Sebastian Vettel
and Lewis Hamilton,
who are these two
four-time world champions.
[crowd cheering]
[reporter]
Esteban, welcome to the top three.
Hi, everyone. Hello.
Thanks for all the support, first of all.
[Croft] Well, fairytale for the team,
and for Ocon as well here.
The speculations to where he might be
in a few races' time,
let alone next season.
There he is,
lining up on the second row.
[Hamilton] Unfortunately, we're not--
We're in a place in Formula One
where you've got some teams
that rather than take, like,
a new up-and-coming kid
they'll take who ever's got the money.
But he needs to be in a great car
because he's one of the top drivers here.
So I hope that opportunity
is there for him.
[Croft] So, Force India,
what a month it has been.
They go into administration,
they get rescued, they get taken over,
they come to Spa,
and they lock out the second row.
[Buxton] No driver likes to be beaten
by their teammate.
They're the first reference.
They're in the same car,
and that's the person you've got to beat.
So someone like Sergio Perez,
if he's getting out-qualified
by Esteban Ocon,
that's gonna really hurt
because this is a guy
with less experience,
but maybe he's showing
he's got more potential.
[Croft] We're minutes away from
racing here at the Singapore Grand Prix.
Since the start of the season,
Esteban Ocon has out-qualified
his teammate
eleven times to four.
So Sergio Perez really needs
a good result tonight.
[engines roaring]
[Croft] It's a good start
for Esteban Ocon.
Two Force Indias together again,
they're going wheel-to-wheel.
Into the wall goes Esteban Ocon!
[crowd gasps]
I got hit by Sergio badly. Badly, badly.
[Perez] Sorry, guys, there was no room.
I basically did not even see him.
[Croft] It's Baku from last year.
It's Spa from last year all over again.
And it's Ocon who is squeezed
into the wall by his teammate.
[Buxton] Esteban's car's in the wall,
thanks to Sergio,
on the first lap of the race.
It's utterly unforgivable.
Esteban, awful to see you
back here in the pit lane.
What happened?
Well, I think it's clear, and I think
everyone saw what happened.
I'm not gonna comment yet.
I want to see the images
and discuss with the team first,
so, uh, we'll see.
Thanks very much.
[Brundle]
I think, "I'm not gonna comment,"
probably says more than Esteban Ocon
really wants to give away.
[Croft]
So one Force India car out of the race,
can Sergio Perez rescue some points
for the team?
[Wright] Checo, Sirotkin ahead.
We will need to overtake him.
[Croft] Is he gonna go for it?
Down the inside maybe?
No. Sergio Perez very nearly ran
into the back of Sergey Sirotkin.
[Perez] Man, Sirotkin is moving
so much on the braking. Too much, man.
[Croft] He's vastly experienced, Martin,
but we're starting to see
increasing desperation from the Mexican.
[Perez] This is a joke, really.
Do you really want me to crash?
[Buxton] Perez's frustration
was so evident to see,
but is that frustration
with Sirotkin in the race,
or is it a deeper frustration
in him not yet knowing his future?
[Croft] Sergio Perez finally finds a way
past Sergey Sirotkin.
-It's not gonna be easy.
-[Brundle] Or does he?
[Croft] They're still going through this.
Oh, no! They've managed to crash.
Perez has got severe damage.
[Wright] Left rear puncture. Box. Box.
[Brundle] I wonder if that was just angry.
He was driving angry.
Singapore was, I think,
a very visual representation
of what's going on in Sergio Perez's head.
[Perez] I tried to close the door
before braking,
but obviously he doesn't move at all
and I probably...
I was over optimistic there.
[Buxton] He looked like a rookie,
completely losing his marbles.
He needs to be impressing the team
and showing that he can be a leader,
not that he's gonna fall apart
when things don't quite look
like they're going his way.
[Croft] A very disappointing night indeed
for the Force India team.
We will have no points for both cars,
so, yeah, it's a terrible weekend.
Better.
[Ocon] Now it is a crucial time.
After the last race,
I have to score a lot of points.
I hope I can finish on a high
to get the seat for next year.
I don't count time, I don't count hours.
It doesn't matter if it's Christmas,
New Year, holidays,
because the most important thing in sport
is to perform and is to do a great job
and to be different than the others.
There's nothing else that counts.
You push to be the best you can, you know.
I've dreamed of this as a kid,
pushing every day,
waking up with the same target,
the same goal.
I'm not gonna let anything
in between me and the performance.
I'm just gonna work harder,
and I think that always pays off.
[Croft] We're here in Mexico City
for the start of the Mexican Grand Prix.
[in Spanish]
Can you hear the crowd cheering?
[Croft in English] It's a huge race
for home favorite Sergio Perez.
And there's some big news for his team,
Racing Point Force India.
After months of speculation,
they've announced their driver
lineup for next season.
In 2019, we'll have Lance Stroll
and Sergio Perez
as our two racecar drivers.
Next year, my situation is still,
you know, quite blurry.
I don't really know what, uh--
what I will be doing.
I don't really understand how
that has gone from being a dream situation
to that situation now.
[Szafnauer]
We saw talent in Sergio,
and, yes, he came
with the backing of Carlos Slim,
so for us, it was an added benefit
because funding
does correlate highly to performance
and we need all the funding we can get.
But first and foremost,
he's there because of his talent.
What I don't understand is that all
the things can be above performance,
above motivation, above work.
Checo has a helicopter
from the hotel to the track.
But, yeah, I'm not at this level yet.
[scoffs]
But, yeah, he's there on the massive sign.
Do you see?
He's everywhere.
He looks happy.
-[man] Checo, Checo!
-[crowd cheering]
Checo!
[Ocon] I'm giving it all my heart
to be here and I'm giving it all I can,
but unfortunately, there's
other things that comes in play
and that's what
I don't really understand
and that's
what disappoints me a bit so far.
Are you looking forward
to driving with Lance?
[laughs]
It's just the lack of opportunities
that this sport offers, you know?
We only have twenty seats.
[people speaking Spanish]
[Perez] It just happens, you know?
One day, it's gonna be me...
[crowd cheering]
[Croft] Just listen to the crowd.
It's race day here
at the Mexican Grand Prix.
Fingers crossed.
And I'm sure the whole of Mexico
are keeping their fingers crossed
for Sergio Perez, who fancies his chances
for a really strong points finish
in today's race.
[Perez] I think very few drivers
in the world
get to experience that amount of support
from their countries.
It is another pressure.
You try to be perfect
and you really work hard
and you really try to focus
on your thing.
[Croft] No love lost between Sergio Perez
and his teammate, Esteban Ocon.
I'm sure Ocon will want to prove
what he's made of
before he leaves Force India.
To beat Checo in Mexico,
it's one of your goals here?
Well, my goal is to do the best I can.
So, um, yeah, it is. [chuckles]
[Buxton] Esteban Ocon has only got
a few races left this season
to deliver the results
that convinces another team
to put him in for 2019.
So right now, he's driving for his career.
Rumors certainly starting to circulate
that Esteban may be within a shot,
a chance of that final seat at Williams.
[Croft] And this is the way it looks.
Ricciardo on pole,
Verstappen in second,
Lewis Hamilton starts third.
And Hamilton driving
for the driver's championship.
If he finishes seventh or higher,
he'll become a five-times world champion.
[engine revs]
Esteban Ocon starts eleventh.
Ocon out-qualifying Sergio Perez,
who starts thirteenth.
[Brundle] Sergio Perez, the local hero.
There's a man who looks like
he's carrying a lot of anticipation,
hope, and stress.
[engines roaring]
[Croft] It's the dash down
to turn one then.
Who's gonna come out on top?
So far, all getting away freely.
Esteban Ocon and Hülkenberg
going wheel-to-wheel.
And there's damage.
[Ocon] I have damaged front wing.
[Joyce] You will be pitting, Esteban.
You will be pitting.
You have half the front wing missing.
Copy.
[Croft] Ocon already into the pits.
He's gone from eleventh to last
in three corners.
[tools whirring]
[Ocon] It's hard at that moment
when you go off of the track.
Even if the guys are really quick,
it's a lot of seconds lost.
I knew I had to catch up
and get back in the race.
[Croft] Nightmare start for Ocon,
but he's back out.
How far can he climb
back up the order?
Checo, your pace is at least as good
as the cars behind, if not better.
[Perez] Yeah, I think I can be
one second quicker than this.
[Perez] At that point in the race,
I was focused on trying
to achieve the best I possibly could.
[Croft] Here goes Sergio Perez,
running in eleventh place.
Sergio Perez is having a go.
Swoops round the outside.
Sergio Perez has got his man
and Mexico stands and applauds.
Brilliant moving, brilliant overtaking.
So, Esteban, we need to be
pushing up to Sirotkin
as much as possible now.
[Croft] Ocon in the Force India
running in 16th.
He has got a long, long way
to go to recover the damage
from the opening few laps.
Now he's behind Sergey Sirotkin
in the Williams.
[Ocon] At that moment,
I knew I had to push hard.
[Croft] Ocon might be
going for it with Sirotkin.
He is going for it, you know.
[Joyce] Well done.
Currently, you're ten seconds
behind Perez.
[Ocon] Copy.
[Croft] I think Perez is having a go.
Is he gonna try and launch one?
He is, down the outside.
Perez swoops round the outside
of Charles Leclerc.
[Wright] Good job, Checo.
[Croft] And he is now up
into eighth place.
[Perez] I was doing
a great, fantastic race.
And I was very lucky to have
such a country behind me.
[all chanting]
Checo, Checo, Checo, Checo, Checo!
[Perez] But then things changed quickly.
[whirring]
[Perez] I have a problem.
I have no brake.
It's very low. Very, very low.
[Wright] Checo, understood. Understood.
See if it improves
with a bit of brake-cooling
after you've been behind other cars.
Maybe brake-cooling helps it a bit.
[Croft] What is the problem
with Sergio Perez?
Kevin Magnussen is closing in
in the Haas behind.
Magnussen looks to the outside
and Perez with a big twitch!
He can barely get the car slowed down.
[Perez] I have no fucking brake, man.
[Croft] And here comes Esteban Ocon.
Still in 15th place.
[Ocon] What's going on?
[Joyce] Perez has a problem ahead
with brakes.
[Ocon] Copy.
[Croft] Ocon hunting down his teammate.
Sergio Perez losing out to Ericsson
and sliding wide again.
Surely the race is over
for the Mexican.
After a tough start,
Ocon in front of his teammate.
[crew] Checo, we're gonna have to retire.
We're gonna have to retire.
Caution stopping.
Look out for the guys.
We'll stop you in the pit lane.
[Croft] And Perez has come into the pits.
The first time ever Sergio Perez
retires from his home Grand Prix.
[Brundle] That is just tragic.
[Perez] It was really hard, you know,
difficult to digest.
You work the whole weekend so hard
with the team.
And, yeah, unfortunately
we get that issue.
[cheering and applause]
I have all of my family,
all of my people there.
My whole country is watching me.
And they all want me
to do incredibly well.
It was very tough.
[Croft] And here comes Hamilton
in fourth place at the moment.
He will become champion
as it stands now.
[Joyce] So, Esteban, keep pushing.
[Croft] There's Esteban Ocon
in the Force India.
He's really going for it here.
[engine revs]
This is a great blast towards turn one.
Ocon looking to the outside
of Hartley.
Late on the brakes.
Wheel to wheel...
[bumping]
And they make contact.
They've gone into each other.
A puff of smoke there
from the rear of that Toro Rosso.
Oh, no.
Debris all over the track too
from the back of the Toro Rosso.
[Ocon] I don't know if I have damage
in the front or not.
Ah, fucking hell,
nothing is going well in this race.
[Joyce] I think we have
some more damage on the car, Esteban.
[Ocon] Copy that. Any advice?
[Joyce] We really need to try
and catch up the group if we can.
So it's head down and let's push.
[Ocon] Copy.
[Joyce] Gasly behind.
So watch out for Gasly.
[Croft] Onboard now with Pierre Gasly.
Is he gonna try and launch one?
He is down the outside.
They come close but they don't touch.
[Brundle] Ocon there
fighting for his racing career.
In my head I was like,
"Focus, try to do the best you can."
[Croft] Ocon and Hartley
at 220 miles an hour.
And Ocon is through.
-Go on. Go on.
-He is now up into eleventh place.
[Joyce] Well done, three laps to go.
But all eyes now on Lewis Hamilton.
The man from Stevenage
has done it once again.
A five-time champion of the world!
[crowd cheering]
[Joyce] Okay, checkered flag.
Well done.
[Croft] And Esteban Ocon crosses the line
to finish in eleventh place.
[Buxton] The fact that Esteban
came home 11th in Mexico,
I think, tells you everything
about the guy.
He took contact on the first lap,
and, yeah, he made contact later on
in the race, and many drivers
might have retired the car,
but he still brought it home.
I find it hard to believe
that Esteban could end up
out of a seat for next season.
[Ocon] My goal has always been
to be a Formula One driver.
You know, I've dreamed of this as a kid.
And now, you know,
I still have no seat for next year.
I mean, as a sportsman,
first you have to believe in yourself,
but it hasn't been easy, for sure.
But I hope, yeah, people will remember
what I did the last two years.[Grosjean] In Formula One,
every race, every season,
you need to be at the top of your game.
But when you go through a tough patch,
you can have doubt.
Spa 2012 was a big moment in my career.
[Croft] And we're racing in Belgium.
It's a good start for Hamilton.
[Brundle] Grosjean cutting across Lewis.
[Croft] Oh! There's contact!
-Grosjean over the top of Alonso.
-[tires squeal]
It has a massive impact!
Alonso's out, Hamilton's out,
Kobayashi's out.
Real drama at the start of the race.
And, uh, I'm afraid I've got to say
I think that's Grosjean's fault.
[Grosjean] After that race,
I went to see a psychologist
to get myself in a better place.
If you use a trainer
to get your body in shape,
why wouldn't you use a psychologist
to train your head?
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[Sims] Let's go up and down here,
do a few of our running drills.
Just loosen up the hips. That's good.
[Grosjean] My name is Romain Grosjean.
I'm 32 years old,
and I'm racing in Formula One
for Haas F1 team.
I was born a competitor.
[Sims] Go for it.
[Grosjean] Everything I do,
I always try to be the best.
[Sims] Quicker.
[Grosjean] Whether it's playing tennis
or running or cooking
or being in a racing car.
But it's been a rough start of the season.
[Croft] Right, on board then,
with Grosjean.
[Brundle] He's weaving around,
trying to get temperature into the tires.
[smashing, metal scraping]
[crew groans]
[Croft] Grosjean, who was
up into a brilliant position
has now crashed behind the safety car.
I'm fucking speechless.
[Croft] That looks like Romain Grosjean,
just going right across the track.
[tires screeching]
-[Gannon] Are you okay, man?
-[Grosjean] Yeah, I'm okay.
I can't fucking believe it.
[Grosjean]
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah.
[Croft] What has happened
to the Haas driver?
[panting]
Fifteen. One more to go.
[Grosjean] We are among
the best in the world
because we made it to Formula One.
There are only 20 seats
in the world in our sport.
A lot of people want to come through
and get your seat.
You need to keep performing
or you can be out of the job.
[Sims] Two to go.
[Croft] Welcome to the south of France,
to the French Grand Prix.
Yes, we are back in France
after an absence of ten years,
and it's round eight
of the Formula One championship
in 2018.
[announcer in French] Hello, ladies and
gentlemen. We're happy to welcome you...
[cheering]
[Grosjean] I'm Swiss and French.
I'm a Swissman
because I hate being late.
I'm always on time.
And I love chocolate.
So, I guess there is no more cliché
than that for Switzerland.
But, my mother was French
and I was raised under a French flag.
So, you know,
it's like a dual personality.
-[in French] Romain, come this way!
-Thank you!
[Croft] A home driver hoping
to make a point here this weekend
is Romain Grosjean.
Still no points so far this season.
[Grosjean] I think it's gonna give
an extra boost,
hearing "La Marseillaise," seeing
all those French flags in the grandstand.
I'm really hoping
that that's a turnaround in the season
and things are going perfectly
all weekend long.
[tools whirring]
When can you start the work, you think?
[inaudible]
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
[Steiner] Haas F-1 is the newest team.
We're in our third season now.
The biggest goal is
to finish better than last year.
We'll see if we can, uh, get four.
To describe Romain as a driver is...
actually, I wouldn't say difficult,
but he's very fast.
On a good day, Romain,
I think he's one of the best out there.
But he makes mistakes.
If the driver keeps crashing,
the biggest thing is he loses,
sometimes, his confidence.
[Grosjean] Okey-dokey.
-Sweet, thank you, boys.
-Okay.
[Steiner] I think the task for Romain
for the rest of the season
is to be consistent.
He's delighted to be racing here
in France at Circuit Paul Ricard,
his first time racing
in a French Grand Prix.
I'm gonna jump down
and get some questions from the guys.
[in French] Good afternoon, Romain.
Who are you going to be
driving for next year?
-[crowd laughing]
-[MC] Oh!
For now, I do not know. We will focus
on the next races. It’s the first time...
[Buxton in English]
Formula One isn't like other sports.
Contracts are negotiated,
they are signed...
who knows when.
And that's why you've always got
to be performing as well as you can.
You're very happy with Haas,
-but obviously, time will tell.
-Correct.
[Buxton] Right, ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together.
Thank Romain Grosjean for his time.
Wish him well.
[cheering and applause]
[in French] Good luck, my friend.
Good luck.
[Grosjean] Just coming
straight on the racing line.
[man] Yeah.
[Buxton] Romain is out of contract
at the end of this season.
Whether he remains in Formula One
is massively open for debate.
[Grosjean] In sixth, it's quite
a high speed. It's like fourth or fifth.
[man] Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Buxton] He's so experienced.
On his day, he is so good.
But he's falling apart this year.
You're only as good as your last race,
and right now, Romain's last races
are not that much to write home about.
-[applause]
-[woman] Bonne chance!
-[Gannon] They like you.
-[Grosjean] They do.
[Gannon] We like you too.
[Croft] We're getting towards the start,
then, of qualifying.
But for the drivers, Martin, it's kind of
their first real competitive chance
to get a feel for this track because...
[engine roaring]
[Buxton] Saturday afternoon
sees qualifying
to determine the starting order
for Sunday's Grand Prix.
His total is... [indistinct]
[Buxton] The further back you qualify,
the harder your race
is going to be on Sunday,
and the harder job you're going to get
scoring points.
[Haas] Well, I think every driver
feels an incredible amount of pressure.
I know Romain is feeling the pressure.
I know that Kevin is an adversary to him.
So, he-- he feels that.
[Magnussen] Your teammate is,
in many ways, your worst enemy.
I get on well with Romain
and I think we have
a healthy relationship as teammates.
But, you know, we are here to do
our own thing and focus on ourselves
and do the best for ourselves.
I don't ever think about,
you know, crashing the car.
I'm willing to do anything
to get those results.
[Steiner] Good guys never win.
In Formula One, if you're just
a good guy and let your teammate pass by,
that doesn't work.
You will never be successful.
It's part of the game.
At this level, uh, you need to fight hard.
Okay.
Once more,
because we will perform a start.
[Magnussen] Okay.
[engine revs]
[Haas] It kind of shows you
the personalities of Formula One guys.
They don't wanna anybody to pass them.
[Croft] And a green light, and so the cars
can come out onto the track.
And, boy, do these boys
need to practice.
[Haas] They're so damn competitive,
even if they're walking out the door,
they'll race to the door.
That's just their nature.
They won't let anybody beat them
at anything.
-[Magnussen] Radio's good, turn one.
-[Salvi] Okay.
Okay, push, now. Good.
[Grosjean] Okay, done. We're green or red?
[man] We're green.
[Gannon] Okay, it's gone. Let's go now.
[Grosjean] Okay, yeah.
[Croft] Onboard with Romain Grosjean.
Looking really fast.
Pushing that Haas to the limit.
[Gannon] Okay, good lap.
He's 1.6 behind.
He's on push.
We need a very big back-off lap.
[Croft] Romain Grosjean
next across the line.
-[Gannon] What a good lap.
-[applause]
[Steiner] Romain was very fast.
He couldn't do anything better.
But he needs to consistently
get the best out of the car.
[Gannon] Romain, driver default Charlie.
Okay, Hamilton, three,
puts you in a half behind on a push,
and we are gonna go
for a timed lap.
We're going for it.
[engine revving]
[tires squeal]
-[man] No!
-[Gannon] Shit, he crashed.
[man groans]
Fuck me.
[Croft] The Haas is out of qualifying,
but it has red flagged the session.
Fuck!
[Gannon] Are you okay? Are you okay?
-[Grosjean] Yeah. I can't engage reverse.
-[engine whirring]
Okay, understood.
[Grosjean] It doesn't want to go reverse.
-[Gannon] Okay.
-I can't reverse.
[Gannon] All right, just take your time.
Take your time.
[Croft] Romain Grosjean in his home race
in Q3,
after all the smiles to get this far,
now comes the agony and the despair
for the Haas team.
He's overcooked it.
[Steiner] I fucking-- I mean, I don't
know how long I can live like this.
At some stage, I need to do something,
you know?
I cannot keep on doing...
just finding excuses for him.
He'll come back here then?
[Gannon] Yeah. Yeah, when
he comes back here...
-[man] Chill out for two minutes. Okay.
-...and then go straight down, yeah.
-Let's not be negative.
-[man] Okay.
[Grosjean] Well, after a crash,
you're never very proud.
Especially when, you know,
you've got a good car
and a good chance for a good Grand Prix.
And of course, you're...
you're frustrated, you're disappointed,
you can be sad,
you can be angry.
Feel good?
Want to go to your room?
[Grosjean] Yeah.
Most of the time, you keep
your helmet on and your visor down
to protect yourself and create a bit
of a gap with the outside world.
You only had a tiny bit of throttle
in the rear one, so...
[Keedle] How are you?
[Grosjean] I'm too tired. I can't sleep.
All this bad luck is draining me.
[man] I thought it might, uh--
I always fight bad news,
bad news, bad news.
[Keedle] It's just too much.
[Grosjean] And you never rest. You always
have a negative feeling of what's next.
[Keedle] Of course. Of course.
What's gonna happen next?
[Grosjean]
And here we are again, negative, boom!
Fuck's sake.
I didn't do a foot wrong
all fucking weekend.
[Grosjean] Sorry...
[Steiner] There's no need.
-There was no need.
-I know.
Fucking hell, Romain, we cannot--
[Grosjean] I know there's no need...
[Komatsu] Right. Okay.
Let's not dwell on it. Come on, yeah?
-We still got good car, yeah?
-Yeah, we do.
We'll score points tomorrow, yeah?
Come on. Okay? Positive.
[Steiner] It was all very good
until it went all very wrong.
In my opinion, it's not even a mistake.
He tries too hard.
That is my opinion about him.
He wants to be faster, obviously,
and then gets into situations
where the car cannot be as fast
because it isn't there.
You need to know how far you can go,
and I think he just tried
to go to the edge and sometimes,
a few times too often,
goes over the edge.
[Steiner] Fuck me.
[Croft] With Romain Grosjean
out of qualifying,
all the Haas team's hopes
now rest with Kevin Magnussen.
[Salvi] We have one time lap,
one time lap.
Come on, let's put the lap together.
[engine revs]
[Croft] And that's ninth place
for Kevin Magnussen.
A disappointing result all around
for Haas.
The car showed
a lot of pace on this track.
[Buxton] Both you and Kevin look really
disappointed at the end of today,
but you have a great car underneath you.
Confident it'll be smiles tomorrow?
Hopefully, yeah. We'll, try to be--
to get some luck for once.
[Buxton] Well done. Thank you.
-[Komatsu] It's okay to start?
-[man] Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Obviously, it was a very disappointing
qualifying for the potential we got.
Um... can we start
with you, please, Romain?
I don't have any explanation
for losing the rear that way.
[Komatsu] Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay.
-[Grosjean] It just went...
-Okay, understood. Right.
[Grosjean] In Formula One,
you do feel lonely sometimes,
because there aren't many people
that can understand
what you're going through.
If you do a mistake on the track,
a lot of people are talking about it.
You can be a hero and you can be a zero
within five seconds.
[Steiner] I think his confidence
is seriously taking lots of hits now.
Like he gave up the "why,"
he don't care anymore about it.
It's my opinion about this.
Because you have nothing to lose.
You know how you're strongest
when you have nothing to lose?
-No?
-Yeah.
We're in 19, the whole sport
is what is on the line, you know?
Yeah.
[Steiner] Yeah? And you try to place him?
[chuckles]
[woman] We are trying to place him.
Exactly.
All right. Can I just have a few--
few minutes?
I want to explain a little bit of things.
I think it was time again to do a dinner,
just to show our appreciation
for what you guys are doing for the team,
you know?
We're having very promising results,
but have very little points.
And I think we are all aware of it.
The only one having points, actually,
is him, you know?
Romain is not here.
Maybe he didn't want to come
because he had no points, maybe.
[laughter]
Or maybe I didn't invite him
because he doesn't deserve any food.
[laughter]
I will tell him tomorrow, by the way,
you know, that I said this, so,
you don't have to run to him
and tell him, you know?
I'm brave enough to say it myself.
But, no, I think
we always are competitive.
Actually sometimes, me personally,
I cannot wait to go to next race
because having a car like this,
you don't have always in your career,
you know?
So we just need to get a little bit lucky.
Uh... we don't need a lot of luck.
We just need to get rid of the unluckiness
and we will be fine.
So, I just want to say, guys,
we still believe in everybody.
You know, we had issues,
but I think we still keep fighting hard.
Enjoy the evening and, uh, enjoy the meal,
and thank you very much from our side.
Thank you, guys.
[applause]
["La Marseillaise" playing]
[cheering]
[jet engines roaring]
[Steiner] The goal for this race
is to make as many points as possible.
And then what I expect is to make points
and bring results with a car like ours,
uh, every weekend.
[Gannon] Romain, loud and clear
and okay to push
and remember... fifth gear.
[Croft] We should be able
to see the lights.
And we're getting ready
for the lights to go on
and the return of Grand Prix racing
to its birthplace of France.
It's lights out and away we go!
The top two get away very well.
Sebastian Vettel is now in hot pursuit
as they head down towards turn one.
[tires squealing]
-[man] No!
-[crew groans]
[man] Oh, fucking hell!
[Grosjean] I got bad, bad hit by behind.
[Gannon] No problem. As far as we can tell,
everything's okay on the car.
[cheering and applause]
[man] Nice!
[Gannon] Currently P-8.
[Croft] And that is Charles Leclerc
under pressure from Romain Grosjean.
Grosjean tries to go around the outside.
-[bumping]
-[tires squealing]
[Grosjean] Man, he completely forced me
off the track again.
We saw it. No problem, keep going.
[Croft] Vettel behind.
Vettel goes for a move on Grosjean.
That looked very, very easy.
Nico Hülkenberg has been getting
after that Haas.
[Grosjean] Again? Fuck's sake!
[Croft] Here goes Bottas.
He's now going wheel to wheel
with Grosjean.
Through the Beausset
and squeezes the Haas off the track there.
-[Steiner] Fuck!
-[Komatsu] Fuck!
[Grosjean] Hey, I was just got pushed
off the track by Bottas again.
[Komatsu] Okay. We saw that. We saw that.
[Steiner] No. Just tell him.
Just focus on driving, not fucking whinge.
Fucking hell.
[Croft] But here comes Kevin Magnussen
on Brendon Hartley into the chicane.
[crew yells]
[Croft] Onboard with Kevin Magnussen,
running in tenth place.
The battle with Stoffel Vandoorne.
[Salvi] Still three laps
of spot one available.
[Croft] Kevin Magnussen gets past
Stoffel Vandoorne
and up into ninth place now
for the Haas.
[Salvi] Okay, you're catching up on Sainz
and pulling away from Leclerc.
This is a good job.
Come on, boy.
[Croft] There's a loss of power
for Carlos Sainz,
and you can now see Kevin Magnussen
and Valterri Bottas closing in
on the Spaniard.
And this could be bonus position finishes.
[Komatsu] Come on, Kev.
Come on, come on, come on.
[Salvi] You have the DRS.
P-6, P-6.
[cheering]
[Salvi] Excellent job, man.
[man] Pressure's good.
Car looks good.
[Salvi] Three laps to go.
[Croft] But can Valterri Bottas get past
Kevin Magnussen here?
[Salvi] P-6, come on, boy.
[Steiner] Hang on, Kevin!
[Croft] Kevin Magnussen
is gonna hold him off.
Magnussen finishes sixth.
[Salvi] Checkered flag.
[Salvi] Today it was
a very solid performance, Kevin.
[laughing]
[Magnussen] Amazing, guys.
Well done. Well done.
Some more points.
Let's keep it going.
We're doing well. We're doing well.
We got a heck of a little driver there.
Yeah, it's too bad Grosjean
couldn't make up one spot.
[Croft] And that's Roman Grosjean
crossing the line in eleventh position,
just one place outside the points.
[Gannon] Checkered flag. Checkered flag.
You drove well.
Sorry we didn't quite get on the points.
Kevin got, uh, P-6.
[Grosjean] Uh, mate, the rules are a joke.
I got pushed twice off the track.
Yeah, result was disappointing.
Um, it's not--
I was not expecting to come 11th.
-Fantastic.
-Fantastic.
[Grosjean] It's always difficult to see
your teammate doing well and you not.
-It's a good time.
-Yeah.
Okay.
[Steiner] Good job, man.
I kept on seeing the fighter.
-Yeah.
-Okay, I was shitting myself.
[Steiner] In any sport at this level,
you just need to be determined.
But I think life generally is like this.
If you always let other people get on,
you stay behind.
[speaking French]
[Steiner] I think at this stage
of the season, looking at drivers, uh...
we're looking around.
[reporter in French] Thank you.
I think Romain knows what to do,
that he keeps his seat.
He's well aware of it,
that we cannot have any more
accidents and damages,
but we will talk about it and see
what is best for the team to go forward.
[thunder rumbles]
[Grosjean] The present form
from the beginning of the season
is not where I should be
and it's not what I can do...
because I know that I can come back
to the level I want to be.
And therefore, I will keep my seat.
[Croft] Romain Grosjean on his way
to getting his first points
since Japan last year.
[Grosjean] Whoo hoo hoo!
[Croft] Grosjean comes home fourth.
[cheering]
It's amazing.
I hope he found his mojo back.
[Croft] Stand by for action.
It is the U.S. Grand Prix.
We never had a good result
in a home Grand Prix.
I hope this is the year.
[Croft] It's a chaotic
opening lap of the race.
Contact with Romain Grosjean.[Leclerc] Formula One is a very
dangerous sport, and it will always be.
[Herbert] Incredibly,
both drivers were okay.
[WIlliams] Safety is always
on the agenda in Formula One.
A lot of work has been done
behind the scenes.
But you see a lot of accidents now
where you don't necessarily expect drivers
to walk away.
Prior to twenty years ago,
they wouldn't necessarily have done so.
[Croft] Everyone breathed a sigh of relief
when the Scot got out
relatively unscathed.
Amazingly, no one is seriously injured.
[Senna] I'm okay, but, yeah, it was,
it was quite-- quite a big one.
[Buxton] Ayrton Senna was widely regarded
as one of, if not the greatest
racing driver that ever lived.
And when he was killed,
we hoped it would be the last fatality
we ever saw in Formula One.
But in 2014, we lost Jules Bianchi.
Formula One driver,
Jules Bianchi, has died.
He left such a mark in the sport
and will be remembered forever.
[Alonso] He was very close to Ferrari.
Maybe he should drive
for Ferrari one day...
[Buxton] This year,
his godson, Charles Leclerc,
made his Formula One debut.
[Herbert] What Charles is doing
is a continuation of Jules' legacy.
Charles has a mission...
a mission to do
what Jules should have done.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[engine roars]
[mooing]
My name is Beat Zehnder.
I'm the team manager
of Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 team.
We are based in Switzerland.
We're very punctual, very precise.
We're very honest, sometimes too honest.
Pretty sure if we would be
a little more dishonest,
probably we could have more success.
We are talent spotters.
Very successful drivers
started with Sauber.
Michael Schumacher.
Sebastian Vettel.
Then we had Kimi Räikkönen.
He's won the championship with Ferrari.
[cheering]
In total we've got something, like,
12 World Championship titles
from a driver which came from Sauber.
But last year we finished bottom
in the Constructors' Championship.
Over the last year,
we have improved a lot.
The difference is the involvement of Fred,
who restructured the company.
[beeps]
Fred is the boss.
He looks a bit grumpy from time to time,
but he's a very funny guy.
[Vasseur] I am Frederic Vasseur.
I am the CEO and Team Principal of Sauber.
Two years ago, Sauber was in big trouble.
[Zehnder]
We have a fantastic wind tunnel,
which we didn't use
for two consecutive years
because we didn't even have
the money to pay the power.
And now we're back to good times again.
[Vasseur] I think the last
six or eight months, we are improving.
But the next races
will be very important for Sauber.
And then we will see what are
the driver option for '19.
[Zehnder] This year,
we've got two great drivers.
I think the potential was there,
but it was just, uh... unfortunate.
[Zehnder] Marcus is five years
in Formula One.
He's a very hard worker
and he has improved a lot.
But yeah, our race pace
was quite strong, actually.
[Zehnder]
Charles, very young, very motivated.
One of the biggest talents
I've ever worked with.
He's 20 years old.
Probably one of the best newcomers
in the last two decades.
At the moment,
Charles is achieving better results.
Of course, for Marcus,
it's a little hard to take.
[Ericsson] I drove there in 2010.
[Leclerc] You drove there?
You were probably
in go-karts or something.
-[laughing]
-A kid.
What were you, ten years old?
No, I was twelve.
[laughing]
My name is Charles Leclerc
and I'm driving
for Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 team.
[indistinct chatter]
[LeClerc] I'm driving in Formula One
for the first time this year.
I am from Monaco.
I remember watching the Grand Prix
at four years old
in my best friend's apartment,
in the exit of the first corner.
And, yeah, I was always searching
for the Ferrari cars, to be honest.
It's-- It's a childhood dream.
I've always dreamed
to be a part of Ferrari.
[cheering]
[Leclerc] I mean,
Ferrari is such a big thing.
You can't imagine to be one
of the two drivers that is in this team.
It's a team that is so mythical.
[tires squealing]
This will be the target next year.
Whether I will achieve it or not,
I don't know.
I always think the thing
that I just need to do
the best job possible in the car
and then the rest will come.
[engine revving]
[tires squealing]
[man on loudspeaker] Kimi Räikkönen!
[cheering]
[crowd] Kimi! Kimi!
Kimi Räikkönen's had a glittering
and glorious career here at Ferrari.
But, of course, he's no longer
the spring chicken he once was.
[Buxton] Kimi, coming to you.
When will we know more about your future?
It's not up to me. Uh... that's about it.
Not my decision in the end so...
[Buxton] For a long time,
people have expected Kimi to move on.
If Kimi is on his way out...
that frees up one of
the most coveted seats in Formula One.
Can Charles Leclerc be a Ferrari driver
after just one year in Formula One?
Um... it's not normally
a decision Ferrari makes,
to go for youth,
and so it's pretty unlikely.
[Leclerc] I think we've had
an incredible first part of the season.
[Croft] Leclerc is driving
a brilliant race
with so little experience in Formula One.
The thing that's been really impressive
about Charles Leclerc
is that he went into a car
that wasn't all that competitive
at the start of the year.
And he's been getting
the best out of it so regularly.
[LeClerc] Yes, yes, yes!
[engineer] Great race, Charles.
P-6 at the end. Fantastic drive. Good job.
[Croft] Charles Leclerc around
the outside! Wow, look at that!
And he's still so young.
[Leclerc] Ah, fuck!
Sorry. Sorry for the bad word.
[Buxton] One moment stands out for me,
which was in Formula Two
when he got to Baku,
and he'd lost his father earlier
in the week.
And we're talking literally
48 hours later, he was in the car.
He then went out, fell to last place,
fought his way through, and won the race.
[cheering]
This was a kid who'd just lost his father.
And he was a kid at the time.
He's a teenager.
To have that kind of mental strength,
I'd never seen anything like it.
[Croft] Welcome to Round 13
of the Formula One world championship.
It is the Belgian Grand Prix.
[engineer] Radio check.
[Leclerc] Radio check, Charles.
[engineer] Copy. Loud and clear.
[Croft] And it's locking up and a crash!
And Fernando Alonso goes over the top
there of Charles Leclerc's Sauber!
[all gasp]
[Brundle] Whoa. An aerial accident there!
And Charles Leclerc makes his way
back to the pit.
He was an innocent bystander in that.
Leclerc, very well protected
from what could've been
a very nasty incident.
[Leclerc] Formula One is a very
dangerous sport, and it will always be.
Crashes happen,
and they will always happen.
[in French] Glad it's nice weather.
It wouldn't have been the same otherwise.
[LeClerc in English] In Spa,
it was quite impressive
from the outside, from the images.
But inside the car,
it wasn't that big of a shock.
I just don't think about it
once I'm in the car.
Everything that is danger I forget it.
A bit more difficult to put
than a Formula One suit.
At least we are warm.
[LeClerc] The situation I was in,
in the last three years
with the loss of my father
and my godfather, Jules,
it was very difficult to take,
and I think it has made me
a lot stronger as a person.
I remember Jules
coming to my first international race.
He gave me a lot of advice
through the years.
I've had some very good times with him.
He had proved himself,
and I think it was just a matter of time
of him being in Ferrari.
I can remember at the moment
of the crash of Jules.
And I could see in my father's eyes
that there was something wrong.
[rain pattering]
[Croft] Towards the end of the race,
the conditions were very wet.
Lap 42, Sutil lost control on turn seven.
A recovery vehicle was dispatched.
Bianchi lost control of his car
and hit the back of the tractor.
[tires screeching]
[Leclerc] I went to see
Jules at the hospital.
And saw how serious it was.
At that moment, we all had
the hope to see him back at one point,
but unfortunately,
this moment didn't happen.
[church bells tolling]
When Jules and my father passed away,
there's not one race going by
without me thinking of them.
They made me the guy that I am now
and also the driver that I am now.
Jules deserves that Ferrari seat.
So that's why
I really want to achieve that.
To just thank him for everything
he has done for me.
-[Gasly] Where is it?
-[woman] The car is in the truck.
-Really?
-Yes. [laughs]
[Gasly] Nice. Really cool.
I'm Pierre Gasly.
I'm 22 years old from France.
I'm driving for Toro Rosso Honda.
It's my first full season in Formula One.
[engine revving]
A number of the bigger teams are now
putting their faith in younger drivers.
I think the example of Max Verstappen
has really convinced teams
that drivers are good enough
at a much younger age
than perhaps in the past.
[Buxton] Pierre Gasly is Red Bull's choice
of driver to replace Daniel Ricciardo.
He's been so impressive
for Toro Rosso this year.
[Croft] Pierre Gasly doing
a sensational job for Toro Rosso.
His first full season with the team.
[cheering]
Gasly going past Leclerc.
[Spini] Okay, Pierre. P-6.
[Gasly] Whoo hoo!
Yes! Yes!
Bahrain stands as, I think, one of
the biggest shocks of the season.
[Spini] P-4. P-4. Fantastic.
This is amazing.
[Gasly] Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
[Croft] Stand up
and applaud the Frenchman!
[reporter] Pierre, you'll be promoted
to Red Bull next year.
Can you believe the progress
and how quick it's been for you?
Yeah. I'm just super excited about it.
It's a massive step.
[Gasly] There's a sort of moment
you get only once in your life,
and, um, it was
really, really something crazy.
[Leclerc] I'm extremely happy for Pierre.
And I think he deserves a Red Bull seat.
And this is very good to see that
the big teams trust the young drivers.
I know Pierre since such a long time.
We started our karting careers together.
We go in holidays together, and I think
he's probably one of the only drivers
that I can call a good friend
out of racing,
which is very rare in this sport.
[Gasly] Our first race with Charles
was probably 2005,
when we were really small, sort of
eight, nine years old, racing together.
And I remember,
like, we got on really well straight away.
In my opinion, you can have
good friends in Formula One.
You just need to know how to separate
what happens on track and off track.
It's something we dreamed about,
and finally ten, twelve years later,
everything is happening and we are there.
Highest level in motorsport
in Formula One.
[cameras clicking]
[applause]
My name is Marcus Ericsson,
and I'm a driver
of Alfa Romeo Sauber F1 team.
I'm from Sweden.
I've just turned 28.
I see myself in my prime of my career,
to be honest.
[cheering and applause]
But I don't have a contract
for next year yet.
It's no secret I want
to stay in Sauber.
I think that's been part of that team
for a long time now,
and we've made
some great progress this year.
[Ericsson] It feels like I'm continuing
to prove myself, what I can do.
[Croft] Super performance
by Marcus Ericsson.
[Brundle] Here we go.
Ericsson against Hartley, up the inside...
And Ericsson is back in the points.
Top ten Marcus Ericsson.
Good session for him.
[Ericsson] Whoo hoo.
[Simon-Chautemps]
P-9. Well bloody well done.
[Ericsson] Thanks.
And I can't wait to get in the car again
and have a strong weekend.
[Croft] Welcome along then
on a Friday afternoon
in this glorious part of Italy.
We have arrived in Monza.
We have come for the Italian Grand Prix.
It is the temple of speed.
It is time for second practice.
[engines roaring]
A lot of drivers
have sorted out their future.
I don't think Marcus Ericsson
is one of them at the moment.
[Simon-Chautemps] Okay, Marcus,
we should have the green light
in five seconds.
And green light, green light.
Straight out.
Okay, Marcus. Radio check.
[Ericsson] Yeah. Right here.
[Simon-Chautemps] Okay.
Okay, that's plus seven all around.
You have nobody behind at the moment.
Go for it.
[tires squealing]
-[Croft] Oh. Something's off.
-[Brundle] Ooh. That's a big crash.
[crowd gasps]
And that's the Sauber
of Marcus Ericcson.
[Croft] That's massive.
[Simon-Chautemps] You okay?
[Zehnder] If you see a car
spinning and turning like he did...
and him travelling at 340 kph...
the first thought you have
is obviously the safety of the driver.
[Croft] Marcus Ericsson's Sauber
lying by the side of the track.
[Simon-Chautemps] You okay?
[Ericsson] No idea what happened.
-[Simon-Chautemps] Okay. Are you okay?
-[Ericsson] Yeah, I am okay.
[cheering]
[Vasseur] Marcus is okay.
He went to the medical center.
For sure he was, first, a bit
disappointed and also bit shocked.
[Zehnder] The accident was
a technical problem on the car.
He was a victim,
nothing he could do to avoid the crash.
[Ericsson] In the end of the day,
you know, it was incredible
to be able to walk away
from an accident like that.
[Zehnder] Ten, fifteen years ago
a similar incident could have been fatal.
[Ericsson] Monza,
I was feeling confident going there.
I was feeling confident in the car,
and then I had that massive crash.
It's obviously quite a scary thing
to have, you know?
It came out of nowhere,
doing 200 miles an hour.
And I was a passenger.
[tires squealing]
It happened so fast.
But whilst the crash was happening,
the time went a bit slower.
I remember just thinking,
"What's going on?"
I was so confused why I was flying
around in the air...
My confidence level and everything goes
down when you have a crash like that.
And you have to sort of
start building yourself up again.
Going to Singapore now and...
[trainer] Okay. Again.
-[grunts]
-On top. There. That's all.
[Ericsson] Singapore is, in my opinion,
the toughest race of the year.
It's key for my future in Formula One.
[panting]
[Croft] Significant changes are afoot
at Ferrari for next season.
After five years, in his second stint
with Ferrari, Kimi Räikkönen is leaving.
[whistling]
[Croft] Räikkönen will stay
in Formula One though... but with Sauber.
[cameras clicking]
[reporter] Well, Kimi,
if we could start with you, please.
You say it wasn't your decision
to leave Ferrari,
but it was your decision
to go back to Sauber.
So just talk us through
why you're doing that.
Why not?
[scattered laughter]
[Räikkönen] Because I want to go.
[reporter] And you're still passionate
about racing? The fire is still--
-No, I-- I'm not, actually, you know?
-[reporters laugh]
I'm just by pure, uh... head games
for you guys out there, yeah.
[reporter]
Well, Kimi, thanks for the insight.
-Let's move on.
-No worries.
When we had the chance
to get Kimi onboard,
we did everything to make it happen.
Kimi Räikkönen coming next year,
probably another driver,
which is gonna give Kimi
a really hard time.
Any news on who that might be?
For sure, we have to sit down next week,
-and we'll take a decision quite soon.
-Yeah.
But, uh... for sure,
it's important, the lineup.
So, strategy at Singapore
um, is dominated by two things,
safety cars and track position.
[Zehnder] We haven't made
a decision of the second seat.
It is important for the team
to make sure that we have the best driver
alongside Kimi.
When he comes to this side
of the driver lineup,
there is always one party
who is not happy with the decision.
Fred deals with such situations
in the best possible way.
[Ericsson]
Kimi going to Sauber, it's big, big news.
Didn't really see that coming.
[elevator dings]
It means that, you know,
it's one seat less in Sauber, so...
I know there's a lot of drivers
that want that final seat,
including myself.
So in Singapore,
I need to deliver for sure.
It's my last chance to do it.
We have the best view in Singapore.
[Leclerc] Yeah.
You can see about 70 percent
of the track.
[Leclerc] I don't know Singapore at all.
It will be my first time here...
and my first night race in Formula One.
It's a very important weekend.
So, I can't wait to discover the track.
[Gasly] So, Singapore
is gonna be a first for me.
Only driven this track in the simulator
and on my Playstation, so...
So... the target is that next year,
I'm the one in the middle.
[laughs]
I'll be good.
I'm not gonna take the Red Bull yet.
[laughs]
No, actually, I'm gonna take it.
Fuck it. I always take it.
[Gasly] Looks like a really exciting,
challenging track.
Very technical, so exactly
the sort of track I like.
Wow. That was a nice one.
Everyone's talking about 2019,
but I still have races
to go with Toro Rosso,
and really want to make
the best out of them.
[Croft] The 15th round of the 2018
Formula One World Championship.
Arguably the most spectacular,
it's the Singapore Grand Prix.
This spectacular city is taken over by
a 3.14 mile circuit on the city streets.
There are 23 corners
to make up a lap,
more than any other race
on the current calendar.
One thousand seven hundred and seventy-one
light projectors
make sure the drivers
can see where they're going at night.
[Zehnder] It's a very special event.
Singapore, because of being
at the equator,
is very hot. It's very humid.
The humidity is 85 plus percent.
So it's very demanding
for the whole team.
For the pit stop crew,
they're wearing their race suit.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[engine roaring]
[Zehnder] And, obviously,
especially for the drivers.
[Medland] It's physically
the hardest they'll push all year.
So when they're training
at the start of the season to be fit,
the race they're thinking of
that they have to hit the level
is the Singapore Grand Prix.
[Gasly] If we were to work out
the difference of balance
in the short run...
It's really hot in the cockpit,
up to sixty degrees in the race.
One of the longest races of the season
as well, two hours.
Let's go for bath.
[groaning]
[moans]
[Gasly] During the weekend, we have
this ice bath, as well, after each session.
It might look a bit silly, you know,
on camera, but....
I just know it's good for my body
-It's so cold in the thing.
-[crew member laughs]
[Ericsson] Just like Sweden,
winter ice bath. [chuckles]
Jumping in the frozen lake. [chuckles]
And when I go up from the bath,
make sure the cameras are focusing
on the right, uh, areas, yeah?
[laughs]
[cameraman] I'll keep it here.
[laughing] The weapon
is not very big at the moment.
[in Swedish] The race is going to be
tough on everyone.
Everyone will overheat, cars and bodies.
[in English] I think I started the weekend
two kilos heavier than I am now already.
So, I will lose quite a bit again
for the race.
Find the limit, stay at the limit,
you can do it.
[Ericsson] I think
before you jump in the car,
there's a lot of things
spinning around in your head.
[cheering]
Charles Leclerc will need to show
that he's worthy of a Ferrari seat.
Charles has added pressure
in that sense.
You want to perform. You want
to do well for yourself, for your team.
Marcus needs to make sure he's scoring
points and finishing in the top ten
if he wants to be
in Formula One next year.
Singapore is a race that could make
or break Marcus' Formula One career.
There's all these emotions,
and then you sort of jump in the car
and all that sort of just goes away.
Then you just go into your bubble
and you just focus on the job.
[countdown timer beeping]
[engines roaring]
[Croft] And they all thread their way
through the first three corners.
Esteban Ocon going into the wall!
[all gasp]
That's what teammates are about.
[Croft] We have
another first lap accident.
Wheel to wheel, Sebastian Vettel
ahead of Max Verstappen.
[Leclerc] Yeah, I got overtaken.
[Becker] Yeah, Gasly ahead.
[Spini] Good job, Pierre. Good job.
Keep going.
Behind you, there is Leclerc and Ericsson.
[Simon-Chautemps] Okay, Marcus,
you're doing good. Keep pushing.
[Becker] Push more if you can,
put some pressure on Gasly ahead.
[Croft] Great battle here.
Charles Leclerc, trying to get past
the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly.
[Gasly] We are really good friends,
but, of course,
you race each single guy
on track the same way.
[Leclerc] We've raced since we were kids
in mini karts against each other.
[Becker] Gasly ahead
seems to struggle with the tires.
[Gasly] We had some exciting
and tight battles.
-[Gasly] Struggling so much, guys.
-[Spini] Push, Pierre. Push.
[tire screeching]
[Croft] Ooh. Big lock-up
for Pierre Gasly there.
And that's gonna cost him a little bit.
Charles Leclerc is right on his tail now.
[Leclerc] Of course, when I finish
in front of him, I'm happy,
like he is
when he's finishing in front of me.
[Croft] Charles Leclerc
almost shoving him around the corners
as they go over the Anderson Bridge.
Leclerc does the old switch-a-roo.
[Gasly] The rivalry's there.
We both wanna be the best.
Come on!
[Gasly] Winning races,
fighting for the championship.
Come on!
[Brundle] That puts Charles Leclerc
ahead of Pierre Gasly.
[cheering]
[Becker] Well done, Charles, good job.
[Gasly] Tires are completely gone.
[Spini] Box, box, Pierre.
[tools whirring]
The race is super, super tough.
Pure pain, you know,
you're dehydrated, getting headaches,
you're really, really tired,
you're struggling with concentration.
[Leclerc] Feels like an eternity.
You're a bit like in a tunnel.
It's extremely intense.
[Simon-Chautemps]
Okay, Marcus, you're doing well.
We are P-8 at the moment.
Keep pushing.
[Croft] Marcus Ericsson still is
the only driver out there
who hasn't pitted.
[Brundle] Ericsson must have all the grip
of an eel swimming in olive oil.
[tires squealing]
[Croft] And Sainz gets past Ericsson.
My tires are gone.
[Simon-Chautemps]
Box, box, box.
[tools whirring]
[Simon-Chautemps] Okay, Marcus,
the situation, you are P-11.
Ahead of you is Hülkenberg.
Hülkenberg is now ten seconds ahead.
Sixteen laps to go. Go for it.
Go, Marcus!
[Simon-Chautemps] That's eight seconds
to Hülkenberg, eight seconds.
Okay, Marcus, Hülkenberg
is now seven seconds ahead.
Push.
You are a second a lap quicker
than Hülkenberg.
You can do it.
[Ericsson] Copy.
[Simon-Chautemps]
Hülkenberg is now six second ahead.
-We're on him.
-Ah, we catch him.
There.
[Simon-Chautemps]
Okay, Hülkenberg, five seconds ahead.
[Ericsson] Copy. Push.
[Simon-Chautemps]
Seven laps to go. Push, push, push.
Five laps to go.
Four laps to go.
Three laps to go.
Two laps to go. Keep pushing.
Last lap, last lap.
Maximum attack now.
[Croft] Lewis Hamilton,
wins the Singapore Grand Prix!
[Simon-Chautemps]
Okay, Marcus, that's it.
P-11.
-[Ericsson] Yeah, thank you.
-[Simon-Chautemps] Thank you, buddy.
[Croft] Ericsson once again finishes
just outside the points.
[Becker] Okay, Charles, that's it.
P-9 at the end.
Excellent race again.
[LeClerc] Ah.
Thank you. Very good race.
[Spini] Okay, Pierre. P-13, P-13
[Gasly] Yeah, yeah.
[Gasly] You've got so much adrenaline
and concentration when you drive.
And suddenly, your body
feels completely different.
You really feel exhausted
at that time.
[Ericsson] I think that was the toughest
eleventh place of my career.
You work so hard for two hours
to not get rewarded with points
when you're so close.
It was very hard to accept.
[speaking French]
[woman] Marcus?
Hey?
How do you feel?
-Pretty good.
-Yeah?
-It's a pity, huh?
-Yeah. It was close.
It was close.
[laughs]
So close. So far away.
I do deserve a sandwich, though.
And maybe a drink later,
but don't tell anyone.
[reporter] The big news this week,
where have you been if you've missed it,
Charles Leclerc
will be joining Ferrari next season.
[in French] So, yeah, I cannot believe it.
It's incredible.
[in English] Selfie, selfie.
Ferrari driver. Ferrari driver.
[laughs] Oh. I was really believing it.
-I know.
-All right.
[man] Congratulations. Well done, mate.
[Leclerc] Thank you. Hello. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
[reporter] Charles Leclerc will be
the second youngest Ferrari driver
in history.
[Leclerc] Yeah, it feels incredible.
They just told me that
we have chosen you as the race driver
for Scuderia Ferrari next year.
And I was just,
"Are you joking or..."
And he was like,
"No, no. Of course, not.
We have chosen you."
And it just felt unbelievable.
-Hey, man, congrats.
-Thank you, man.
Jules probably deserved this place
more than I do,
and I'm extremely happy to be the one.
And I'll try to honor him
the way he deserves,
and bring him the success
he deserves to have.
[man] Are you okay, Nico?
[Hülkenberg]
Get me out. There's fire.
-[man] Yeah.
-[Hülkenberg] There's fire.
[opera music playing][Croft] Oh! Someone's had a big off.
Renault made contact there with Haas.
[Grosjean on radio]
That was a terrorist attack.
He just turned into me, mate.
[Gannon] Yeah, they're not getting very
close on the walk back there, are they?
[Medland] The midfield this year has been
one of the most thrilling battles
we've had in a long time.
There's millions of dollars to play for.
And all of it's really boiled down
to just two teams...
Renault and Haas.
[Will Buxton] It's old Europe
versus the New World.
French royalty versus raw American power.
[engine roars]
If Haas beats us, it would be a disaster.
I think it's a great fight.
We're ready to go to war.
[Buxton] This battle for fourth place,
it's brilliant and brutal.
[Hülkenberg] He pushed me off the track.
[Buxton] And here's the mad thing:
their drivers don't get on.
[Croft] Magnussen
on the inside with Hülkenberg.
[Hülkenberg] Magnussen just ran me
off the track. What a cock!
Once again
the most unsporting driver on the grid.
-Suck my balls, mate.
-Very good, man.
It's a tough rivalry.
[Buxton] Renault
really don't wanna be beaten by Haas.
It's a mighty, mighty fight.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[Steiner]
Racing, in America, it's in the blood.
NASCAR, IndyCar, it's a long history.
At Haas F1, we want our drivers
to have that same American passion.
[Tony Stewart] You ready for this?
-I have no idea. We'll see.
-[Stewart laughing]
How's it going?
[Stewart] You'll have fun.
What's the worst that can happen?
[laughing]
-[Stewart] Piece of cake.
-We've got the ambulance ready, so...
[Magnussen chuckles]
[Magnussen] This kind of team
works for me,
'cause some Formula One teams go racing
with money
and other, you know, Formula One teams
go racing with their heart.
Haas is clearly one of those teams
you don't feel like you're racing
for commercial reasons.
-So, is the car ready?
-Yeah.
Do you know what to do?
Yeah. Flat out.
[laughing]
[Steiner] Haas F1 is the first
American team in more than 30 years.
When we started it,
everybody told us we would fail.
"Why should you guys in America succeed?"
[Magnussen] Whoo hoo!
It's not easy to put together a team
and make it work.
[Croft] Kevin Magnussen's really got
the bit between his teeth.
Haas rise to the occasion once more.
[Magnussen]
Haas have done that in NASCAR.
Now in our Formula One third year,
we're already fighting the big boys.
-[Croft] Sensational from Haas!
-[Steiner] Awesome!
-[Magnussen] Boy, I need a... drink.
-[Stewart laughing]
I don't know what I need.
[all laughing]
[Steiner] You just have
to drive like that again this weekend.
[Magnussen]
Are you gonna give me a rub down?
-[laughing]
-[Steiner] Uh, no.
[Croft] We're deep in the heart of Texas,
the Circuit of the Americas.
It is the United States Grand Prix.
Whoo! USA! USA!
[Croft] And for Formula One's
only American team,
isn't it great to be back home?
Grosjean! Grosjean!
Haas have had
a really up and down season.
At the start,
you had Romain Grosjean really going
to pieces in the early races in the year.
But he's found his form
and come back on song.
[Croft] Grosjean comes home fourth.
[Grosjean] Whoo hoo!
[crowd cheering]
[Buxton] Now both drivers are secured
for another season into 2019.
Everything seems
to be coming together for them.
They're confident.
They're hungry to fight.
But coming into Austin,
it really is a massive one.
If they can maintain the great performance
that they've shown over recent races,
they might just be able
to put one hand on that fourth place
in the championship.
[cameras clicking]
[reporter] What's the general vibe
around the team at the moment?
What's the atmosphere like?
Yeah, the atmosphere is great.
The team is going well.
Very much looking forward to the race.
And I'll just try to bring
some good points back home
and a great show for our fans.
[Grosjean] It's very satisfying.
This year, we've got a really good car
for the first time
coming in a home race.
[tools whirring]
And, you know,
Austin is a great place for us.
We're gonna see a lot of Haas T-shirt,
cap, you know, and flags.
Whatsoever we can see on the track.
So, we're here for the the fight
with Renault, ready to go to war.
Because you wanna fight Renault,
of course.
Yeah, that's the big target.
I think it's a great fight
and it's a great challenge for us.
Yeah, you are fighting Renault, who
is a huge car brand all over the world.
So, how do you see this fight?
Well, you're right.
You know, Renault's a huge brand,
but they're not the biggest brand
in the United States, I can tell you that.
All, uh... regimes come to an end
sooner or later.
For Haas to finish fourth
in only their third season would be...
uh, frankly it would be--
it would be unbelievable,
because the team they're up against
Renault... is one of,
if not the biggest auto manufacturer
in the world.
They have a wealth of experience
in not just competing in Formula One,
but winning world championships.
It is however, at the moment,
a midfield team
trying desperately to rebuild itself.
And in the balance of where we are
from a competitive standpoint right now,
Renault lost their momentum
and they need to get it back.
[Croft] Renault seem to have stalled a bit
in terms of their point scoring of late.
[Brundle] They're still hanging on
to fourth place, but only just.
Eight points separate them
from their American rivals.
And if their recent form
is anything to go by,
it's not looking good for the French.
[Croft] Oh, no.
[tires screeching]
Nightmare for Renault.
[tires squealing]
And that's Nico Hülkenberg into the wall.
[reporter] Where are Renault
at the moment?
Because it does look as though it's been
a bit of a struggle the last few races.
Well, we are where we are. I mean...
But in terms of the true form
of the team, though,
you were looking so strong
in fourth and now... it's not ideal.
Um...
[tires squealing]
[Croft] What has happened?
Oh, the Renault goes wide.
Is he gonna try and launch?
Oh, no!
The Renault's made contact there.
Carlos Sainz is out of this race.
We are fourth. That's the reality,
but it is a very tough midfield.
And since Barcelona,
they've been a faster car than us,
really, so, uh, that's worrying.
[Sainz] Renault, at the moment,
is in a very tricky situation.
I think if, if Haas beats us,
it would be a disaster.
I think we all know how important
that fourth place is for Renault.
I think we all feel it inside the team.
We feel the pressure.
What you have to understand about Renault
is that they've invested millions
in their pursuit of the top three teams.
That means there's a huge amount
of expectation on them,
not only from their shareholders,
but from the whole of France.
Renault's connected to the French people.
It's a partly state-owned company.
Um, so it's a huge responsibility,
so you don't want to mess it up.
This year, fourth is very important to us.
We need to show to the world
that our ambition to become a top team
and fight with the best is credible.
I just hope you see
it's a stepping platform
if we want to join the top three.
But coming in to Austin,
it's difficult to hide the fact
we've lost confidence.
[country music playing on radio]
♪ There's a devil in my soul ♪
Proper music, huh?
Welcome to Texas.
Bleh.
When the weather is like this here,
it's like...
[blows raspberry]
[Buxton] Let's talk a little bit
about the threat of Haas. Have they...
Haas? Who are they?
I've never heard about them.
They're just
this other little American team.
-There is an American team?
-I think so, yeah.
Did you know?
I'm Nico Hülkenberg.
I'm 30 years old from Germany
and I drive
for Renault Sport Formula One team.
Well, the atmosphere could be better.
It's challenging. Everyone realizes that.
Um... many things didn't go
the way we wanted them to go.
But we have to focus on what is ahead.
It's all about the race.
The race is the only thing that counts.
[man] Nico Hülkenberg!
[applause]
[kid] You're famous!
[laughing]
Hello. How are you guys?
[boy] Wait, how much races did you win?
-None yet, unfortunately. Yeah.
-[girl] Oh, wait, really?
-[laughing]
-How are you famous?
-Wait, you didn't win any?
-No.
[girl] Do you have a good mindset?
Do you think you will win?
It's not so easy. It's very hard
to achieve, you know.
[boy] So, how many races
have you ever won?
Quite a few.
-[kid] Microsoft! I wanna play games.
-But in Formula One, not so many!
-[Hülkenberg laughs] They're disappointed.
-[man] This Sunday!
This Sunday, I'll try. I'll go for it.
[Hülkenberg] Expectations, you know...
I've had to deal with them all my career.
My personal expectations to myself
are probably higher than anyone else.
This is what I've been dreaming about
and worked towards
since I am eight years old.
Nico...
[clicks tongue]
Nico Hülkenberg has been viewed
as this champion-in-waiting for a decade.
Phenomenally successful in junior career,
but just never achieved what everybody
thought he would in Formula One.
This is a guy who now holds the record
for the most races without a podium.
[Croft] Oh, dear. Boom!
Front wing just fell off.
[Brundle] That is dreadful luck.
[Croft] Hülkenberg goes off the track,
losing his left wheel.
Hülkenberg, for the second year
in a row, is out of this race.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh!
[Abiteboul] He is frustrated.
He is frustrated, having been,
most of his life, a midfielder.
All of these years spent
without podium, without wins.
I mean, no, Nico, given the right car,
is capable of being world champion.
He is world champion material,
there is no doubt about that.
[Hülkenberg] I'm getting older,
but, you know, I still have
that aim and the goal
to become Formula One world champion
and to win races.
I wanna-- You know,
I will keep going and not lift off
till I have achieved that.
And now with Renault, you know,
I have a team and a partner,
because believe I can.
But first we have to get
to that fourth place.
And beat Haas. [laughs]
[Buxton] Ladies and gentlemen, Gene Haas.
[cheering and applause]
It looks like an incredibly competitive
weekend for your boys.
Yeah, our competitors are just
pains in the butt. [laughing]
-[Buxton] Yeah, but--
-[Haas] So you just get out of the way.
[man] Are you optimistic?
Renault's having a bit of a wobble.
-What do you think?
-Yes.
Correct. [chuckles]
Thank you. Thank you.
[Medland] Coming into race day, there'll
be a massive feeling of excitement
in the Haas F1 camp.
They might have been underdogs earlier
in the season, but they're not anymore.
Remember, they've got a Ferrari engine,
and the way they've developed this car
during the year
has now made them much faster
than their French counterparts.
You would really have to say
that this race is theirs for the taking.
We all know that we're
in the fight for fourth.
It's getting tight now. For sure,
Renault will try to win it as well.
I'm confident
with the performance of the car.
Just keep focused, do what you're doing.
Do not change anything.
Just do always-- get to the best,
and, uh... we will finish fourth.
You know, a lot of people wouldn't have
given us any chance to achieve this.
Renault has got three or four times
the amount of people we have got.
More than double the budget we have got.
But I think Renault has realized
that, at the track, they cannot beat us.
Hey, you know, Kevin,
you'll get a chance to beat Nico as well.
That, I think, means a lot to him.
[laughing]
There's a bit of history
between Magnussen and Hülkenberg,
and part of it stems
from Magnussen's own history with Renault.
He used to drive for that team
and felt Renault didn't have enough faith
in him to try and keep him.
He was replaced by Nico.
So, Kevin Magnussen's
definitely had a point to prove.
[Magnussen] It's going to be a dirty race.
Kevin and Nico don't get on... at all.
[Hülkenberg]
Magnussen just ran me off the track.
How can I-- How can I say?
It's-- It's a tough rivalry.
When it comes to racing, he's just nasty.
And what he does is just, you know,
ruthless, being an asshole, basically.
[Magnussen] It's no secret.
I can't wait to beat him.
It's a big target for me, personally.
You know, it is what it is.
[Steiner] A lot of people say Kevin
is the bad boy of Formula One.
But he's a pure racer.
He fights for everything.
He doesn't leave anything behind.
You know, he would never give up.
And he can be
one of the best in Formula One.
[Croft] So, it all comes down to this.
The outcome of this race
could transform the fortunes
of one of these teams.
On the grid,
Renault and Haas are side by side today.
Who's got the fastest pace?
Who can show what they're made of
when it really matters?

♪ By the dawn's early light ♪
♪ What so proudly we hail ♪
♪ At the twilight's last gleaming ♪

[Magnussen] We've been
very neck-and-neck the whole year.
But I feel like this is the chance
to actually prove which of us
is better as individuals,
as racing drivers.

[crowd cheering]
[Magnussen] Radio check, mate.
Radio check.
[Slade] Track temperature was 29 degrees.
[Hülkenberg] You're just sitting there,
you know, waiting.
It's so fucking intense.
You feel, like, your heart, you know,
pumping, "boom, boom"
and it feels like it's kind of
in your mouth.
At that moment, you just need to function.
[Magnussen] Everything that
I've worked towards in my career so far
has come purely down to this moment.
[engines roar]
[Croft] Very good start indeed
by Nico Hülkenberg in the Renault.
[Magnussen] Oh, for fuck's sake.
[Croft] Into turn one...
Oh! There's contact.
Carlos Sainz going wide in the Renault.
[Grosjean] Fuck! Come on!
Fuck.
Oh! Grojean's hit Leclerc.
Leclerc's spinning. Grojean's got damage.
No!
Oh.
[Grosjean] Fuck! Front wing.
[Gannon] Box now. Box now.
[Croft] We have our first retirement
and it's the home team, Haas.
-Too much damage on Grosjean's car.
-[Brundle] Oh, that is such a shame.
[Grosjean] Sorry.
[Croft] Lap one and Haas
are already a car down.
[Steiner] You think this cannot happen.
It's just like realizing
that there was a big opportunity
and you cannot make it right again.
[Grosjean] I was just thinking,
"Please, not again."
I was really trying to be careful,
but of course, when it's your home race,
you want to do well.
So, maybe I pushed too hard.
You're talking about, "Maybe I brake
two-tenths of a second too late."
But at that speed, it's about ten meters
and ten meters means
that you have contact or not.
I apologized to all the team.
Obviously, not what we wanted
in the fight with Renault,
and, you know, the most painful
at that point
is seeing that Renault,
I think they were sixth and seventh.
A big gap for Kevin to, uh, close.
[Croft] There's more contact.
And another car spinning off.
[tires squealing]
Wow!
[Slade] You're doing a great job, Nico.
Grosjean out of the race.
Magnussen is P-10.
[Hülkenberg] You know, you need to
be really focused in that moment.
You might have a good start,
but Kevin is quick.
He's always gonna be
a serious, you know, threat to us.
[Salvi] Stay positive,
stay positive. It's a long race ahead.
[Steiner] With one driver...
sure, it's more difficult now,
but in racing, you never give up.
In situations like this,
you race hard, you know.
[Croft] Kevin Magnussen
turning it up a notch.
If he wants to catch those Renaults,
he's gonna have to fight his way
through that midfield.
[Magnussen] All the responsibility
is on you...
and I'm not willing
to make any compromises.
[Magnussen] Fucking hell.
They're just really slow.
[Salvi] Keep on pushing, Kevin.
-Go on, mate.
-Go on.
[Croft] Kevin Magnussen
is closing the gap.
But with both Renaults
in point-scoring positions,
Haas have a mountain to climb.
Sainz was after the curb
on turn one, you know?
[Steiner] So you think Sainz got
an advantage by doing this?
[Grosjean] It's a big advantage to them.
[Steiner] Can you please have a look
at the start of Sainz,
because he apparently cut
the corner totally,
you know, to get an advantage.
[Steiner] What were we supposed to do?
The Renaults were in front of us.
We cannot sit back and just see,
"Oh, maybe we get lucky
and they retire
and then we get the points."
No. You need to go
and attack at that point,
because there's nothing left to lose.
[Loos] Carlos, we have a situation.
[Sainz] What?
[man] Carlos has a five-second penalty
for going off the track.
[Croft] You could not script this moment
if you sat down at the start
of the season and you tried it.
[Sainz] Ah, what a shame.
[Croft] Carlos Sainz, at the moment,
is up into seventh place.
When he comes into his pit-stop,
he'll have to stay stationary
for five seconds.
[Sainz] I couldn't believe it.
I was thinking,
"Why? Why? Why? Why?
And how is it possible?"
[Croft] A five-second time penalty.
He'll serve it in his pit-stop.
This will cost him time and could cost him
and Renault an awful lot of points.
[Sainz] We were in a good position.
Five seconds...
it feels like forever.
[Croft] With Sainz held up in the pits,
Magnussen is able
to get ahead of him.
[man] Yes!
[Croft] The Haas driver is
giving it everything.
And into the pits comes
the other Renault of Hülkenberg.
[Slade] Standby, Nico.
[Croft] Unbelievable.
What a turnaround for Haas.
Magnussen has made it up to sixth place.
-Oh!
-[man] Yes!
[Salvi] Great job.
You are pulling away from Hülkenberg.
[tools whirring]
[Hülkenberg] Magnussen is in front, right?
[Slade] Magnussen is in front.
Now is the time to push
as hard as you can.
Push like hell.
[Croft] The battle for best of the rest
has come down to these two drivers,
these two rivals,
these two men with everything to prove.
[Salvi] Hülkenberg on a very good lap.
[Magnussen]
Yeah. He's picking up the pace now.
We're under threat.
[Croft] Hülkenberg chasing down Magnussen.
This is a massive scrap.
They are both pushing
to the absolute limit.
[engine shudders]
[Hülkenberg] Oh, no.
[Slade] We've got a problem, Nico.
You are losing
a little bit of performance.
So, look after the rear tires.
[Hülkenberg] Annoying.
[Croft] Right rear
is not looking very good.
I think it's got some light blistering
in the middle of the right rear tire.
[Hülkenberg] Fuck!
[Croft]
And Magnussen is starting to pull away.
-[Hülkenberg] Fuck.
-[Slade] Sorry, Nico.
[Hülkenberg] The pace is slow.
[Hülkenberg]
All of a sudden, the car has problems.
You're like, "This can't be true."
Some one thing was wrong
in a split second
and everything is, you know--
everything is suddenly much harder.
[engine revving weakly]
[Hülkenberg]
Losing the rear more and more now.
[Slade] Magnussen has boxed.
Magnussen has boxed.
[Salvi] Twenty seconds, 20 seconds.
[Croft] So Magnussen
has been called in for his pit stop.
[Brundle] Hülkenberg has a chance
to regain his advantage.
[Croft] Hülkenberg retakes the position,
but with the Renault's rear tire problems,
can he hold onto it?
[Salvi] We need to fight until the end.
Keep on pushing.
[Magnussen]
You just have to focus on yourself.
You know, our battle is probably gonna
go down to the last lap.
It's gonna go down to the very end.
[Croft] Will Magnussen catch Hülkenberg?
[Hülkenberg] How many laps to go?
[Slade] Eleven laps to go.
[Magnussen] Give me everything.
I need everything.
[Croft] A very dramatic final few laps.
Can Hülkenberg keep going on these tires?
[Slade] Seven laps to go, Nico.
Gap to Magnussen
behind you is 7.3.
[Croft] Oh! Locking up there.
Hülkenberg's in real trouble.
[Hülkenberg] Tires are struggling.
[Slade] Hang on, Nico.
[Hülkenberg] You know,
if you do a mistake, it's gonna hurt you.
[Slade] You're doing a great job
in the circumstances, Nico.
Just need a few more laps,
you're doing a great job, mate.
[Hülkenberg] I think we're fucked.
[Hülkenberg] You might be in front,
but you're burning through your tires.
And you can see,
you know, the defeat is coming.
[melancholy music playing]
You think about all these times
you have bad luck in your career.
I can't really lose much more.
But fortunately...
not this time.
[Hülkenberg] Whoo!
[Croft] Hülkenberg crosses the line
ahead of Magnussen.
Somehow, he managed to hold on.
[Slade] Absolutely brilliant, Nico.
That was beautifully judged there.
Thank you very much.
[Hülkenberg] Thanks, mate.
[Croft] The Renault
crosses the line in sixth.
Those points should be enough to ensure
Renault take fourth
in the Constructor's Championship
this season.
[Brundle] Making Renault best of the rest.
Wow! Thank you.
How are you doing?
[Hülkenberg] You know, I needed that.
You know, it was
really important for myself,
for my own confidence, you know,
and I just, like...
You feel free suddenly again, you know?
You got all that weight from your chest,
from your shoulders and...
a very great feeling.
What Hülkenberg did in Austin
really is a huge moment for Renault.
Not only do they win
best of the rest for 2018,
but they keep that dream alive
that they can and will be
world champions once again.
[Magnussen] Fucking hell.
You know, it's embarrassing.
During the last laps,
I thought it would be fine.
But we've lost-- lost out.
We just gotta, you know,
take that on our shoulders
and try and do better next year.
You know, I believe we can do better.
[Steiner] Fuck. Fucking hell!
I'm afraid to get off the fucking pitwall.
[man] Fucking hell.
[Steiner] You sit there, like, beaten up
on your seat and just think,
"How did we do this all wrong?
We should have done better."
Everybody in Haas wants to do better.
I don't know.
Maybe it just wasn't our time.
[in French] Thank you.
[in Enlgish] Do you think, next year,
you're gonna have more races like that?
Well, of course.
We want to close the gap
to the top three teams.
You know, it's, obviously, a challenge.
Of course, everybody
is working and pushing hard for that.
Thank you.
I think Nico, with his talents,
evidenced by his performance in Austin...
it shows that there is some things
that doesn't work right now
in Formula One.
You can't have a driver like Nico
not on a podium.
Thank you.
[Abiteboul]
He's world champion material.
He deserves a car
that can match his skills.
And I just hope that one day
we can see that in action,
because he deserves it.[Croft] It's been a brilliant year.
It's passed by in an absolute blur.
We've had a lot of stories.
There's been drama. There was action.
There's been crashes.
There's been everything going on.
It was so up and down,
it was a roller-coaster.
[Croft] Strap yourselves in
and welcome along to the ride.
And a big crash there!
[Steiner] In Formula One,
the highs are very high...
[Croft] Magnussen and Grosjean
will start fifth and sixth.
Yeah, with the big boys, yeah?
[Brundle] That is
a staggering achievement for Haas.
[Steiner] But the lows are very low.
[Croft] What is happening down at Haas?
The wheels have literally fallen off.
Fuck. We fucking look
like a bunch of wankers.
[Croft] Romain Grosjean loses it.
Right across the track.
[Gannon] Oh, mate, I'm sorry.
[Horner] Our drivers
have been phenomenal this season.
[Croft] He's gone from sixth to first.
[Ricciardo] Did it, y'all. Did it. Whoo!
I'm tripping major nutsack right now.
[Croft] Redemption day for Ricciardo.
He wins in Monaco!
[Ricciardo] This is my time.
It's my fucking time.
Max had a difficult start to the year.
[Croft] Oh, Verstappen's off!
[Verstappen] Fuck!
[Croft] Ricciardo desperate
to get past his teammate.
[Brundle] Double disaster for Red Bull.
Oh, dear.
[Ricciardo] Holy shit.
- [interviewer] How pissed off were you?
- Very.
Why have you had so many accidents?
I get really tired of all the questions,
so I think
if I get a few more,
I'll head-butt someone.
[Horner] From Montreal onwards,
Max has driven brilliantly.
[Croft] Max Verstappen wins
the Austrian Grand Prix.
[Verstappen] Yes!
Oh, this feels fucking good.
[Brundle] Hang on a minute,
Daniel Ricciardo is going to Renault.
[Ricciardo] I just felt I needed
a fresh start.
Have you got any money to spend
on your engine,
now you've spent it all on your driver?
We've got plenty of money.
[Abiteboul] It's been a good season,
but there is still
a number of frustrations.
[man] Stop the car. You've got fire.
[Croft] Sainz on the outside
of the Renault...
But now Grosjean, once again,
involved in a collision.
I fucking... I don't know how long
I can live like this.
[Croft] Nico Hülkenberg's locking up!
And there's been a crash!
Fernando Alonso goes over the top
of Charles Leclerc's Sauber!
Wow!
We are expecting
to have difficulty with McLaren.
[Croft] Not another problem for McLaren.
[Abiteboul] Turned out to be Haas.
[Croft] Haas get
their best ever finish in Formula One.
[Grosjean] Finally, I give you
what you deserve, boys. Whoo!
[Croft] Grosjean comes home fourth place.
Yes! [laughs]
Right now, for us,
points are very hard to come by.
[Croft] Alonso and Sirotkin,
wheel-to-wheel!
[Alonso] Fucking stupid.
You take care, and they crash into you.
McLaren is Team Fernando.
[Brown] When you have a driver
of Fernando's caliber,
you wanna keep them in your racing team.
[Buxton] He's making the decisions.
Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso
is to retire from Formula One.
[reporter] Would you have stayed
if you could have had a competitive car?
[Medland] He's one
of the greatest drivers we've ever seen,
so it feels like the end of an era.
We've done good steps,
but we need to go faster.
[Croft] Lewis Hamilton,
a five-time champion of the world!
[man] Yes! That's the double, mate.
[Croft] For the fifth year in succession,
Mercedes are the Constructors Champions.
That's the last race in the season,
and it's still so intense.
[Croft] Ericsson's off.
And there's a fire.
[Simon-Chautemps] Get out of there.
Get out of there quick.
F1, it never stops.
Always finish the season on a high.
You're gonna see drivers and teams
throwing caution to the wind
and absolutely going for it.
[pneumatic tools whirring]
[Croft] One more time in 2018.
We've been around the world
from Melbourne in March
to here in Abu Dhabi in November.
The final round of the Formula One season
was set for a dramatic night,
under the lights here in Abu Dhabi,
the most expensive F1 venue
ever constructed.
The gloves are off.
The drivers just wanna go at it now
for one more time in 2018.
Guenther, when you look back
on 2018, what do you mainly see?
Oh, that's a difficult question,
how much time have you got?
[crowd cheering]
[Croft] Next year,
only two of the ten teams
are keeping the same driver lineup.
Fernando Alonso, his final race,
bidding farewell.
[all] Fernando!
- Sexy!
- Fernando!
[Croft] Of course, Daniel Ricciardo,
leaving Red Bull after this evening.
Going to the Renault team.
End of term now, how would you give
yourself a grade for this term?
I'm gonna say
probably an "L"  for "loser."
- [laughs]
- Um... yeah.
Likeable. L for "likeable."
Or a "G" for "good-looking."
I don't know. One of those.
- Let's stick to "L" for "likeable."
- [laughs]
The second half of the season's been
a lot of misfortune really
and things out of my control.
[Ricciardo] Basically lost the power.
[Rennie] Okay.
[yelling] Fuck!
It's frustrating.
And sometimes you feel betrayed by the car
when it lets you down.
When it doesn't work, you just
want to express a lot of anger.
[cheering and applause]
[Ricciardo] If we could finish
this weekend in a good way,
it would soften a lot of the blows
we've had this year.
Deep down, of course, my heart
would have loved a title with Red Bull,
just to complete the journey.
Right now, I'm just looking forward
to finishing on a high.
It's that satisfaction of knowing
that I've still got it
and proving it to people
that I've still got a lot of fire in me.
It's a Sunday night. This should be fun.
Monday recovering, I guess.
Recovering from a victory,
from a hangover...
[man] A victory?
It's been a long time.
I know, I forgot
how to say the word "victory," but...
[laughs]
[Horner] We're going into the final race
with Daniel.
It's the last time
he'll put on the Red Bull overalls.
Um... but as one chapter closes,
another one opens.
We're excited about Pierre Gasly.
And, you know, Daniel's leaving
to go to Renault.
Is he making the right career choice?
No. The next year's one will be faster.
You reckon we will be slower?
[laughing]
[Verstappen]
Daniel's still racing  Formula One,
so I won't necessarily miss him,
but I'll probably wave at him
when I'm gonna lap him next year.
That's the target.
[photgrapher]
One, two, three. Go. And again.
[Buxton] There's a lot riding
on this last race.
For Daniel, it's his last opportunity...
to beat Max Verstappen as his teammate,
in equal machinery.
All right, thanks very much.
Have a nice Christmas.
[applause]
[Verstappen] It's been a challenging year
in the beginning.
But since Monaco,
I've been driving a lot better.
I've been really strong
compared to Daniel,
so definitely turned around the season.
Max, he's one
of the hardest racers out there.
He shows no fear.
He gives no quarter.
[Croft] Max Verstappen moves over
to the right hand side of Lewis Hamilton,
the race leader.
And there's a Force India
coming down the hill...
[Verstappen] I have the Force India
behind me, pushing.
[Croft] No! Verstappen's off!
[Verstappen]
What a fucking idiot! Fuck!
[Croft] And that has cost him
the lead of the race.
Max should have won in Brazil.
He was in total control of that Grand Prix
until Esteban Ocon tried
to unlap himself.
[inaudable]
[Croft] Verstappen is absolutely seething.
That was Esteban Ocon.
[Buxton] Ultimately,
it robbed Max of the win.
But Max had the opportunity
to have saved himself all of that strife.
Just give him a little bit more space.
I think Max still has a little bit
of maturing to go,
learning which fights to fight
and which to let go.
[reporter] Max, can you just explain
what happened between you
and Esteban after the race?
Um...
I don't really have a lot
to comment on that.
Except that he was being a pussy.
- [man 1] Okay.
- [man 2] Okay. Next one, please?
[Verstappen] Like, I said at one point,
like, "You should understand my reaction
if you could hear what he said
to me on the scales."
'Cause he basically
started laughing at me,
and then he was like,
"Ha, well, I was faster,
and so, I wanted to overtake you."
Like that.
He didn't even,
like, apologize for the crash.
- And that triggered me to push him.
- Yeah.
What do you think about the incident
between Max and Esteban?
Whilst we don't condone violence
in any way,
emotions run high, and if they didn't,
they wouldn't be Grand Prix drivers.
Thank you.
[Horner] In the final race of the season,
there's an opportunity for Max to move up
the order by one or two places,
from fifth to third
in the driver's championship.
I think he's just very keen as well
to rubber-stamp the form that he's shown.
Uh, well, we are closer than expected.
We'll definitely try to score a point.
Thank you.
[Medland] Max Verstappen, he could
really stamp his authority and say,
"I'm gonna be a challenger
for the championship next season."
So I think it will be hard for Verstappen,
but there's every chance.
[Croft] Here we go, in Abu Dhabi.
Fernando Alonso's 311th and final start.
Daniel Ricciardo wants one more victory.
He's desperate
for one more win this season.
The cars lining up on the grid
for the final time.
Daniel Ricciardo in fifth.
Max Verstappen right behind him in sixth.
[Rennie] Daniel, just one rev check,
please. One rev check.
- All right.
- [engine revs]
This is it, fellas.
Let's fucking have it.
[Croft] Could Red Bull have a little
problem on their hands this afternoon?
Because Max Verstappen
and Daniel Ricciardo,
they can't both be on a winning strategy.
Of course, Daniel Ricciardo
leaving Red Bull,
I would have thought,
if there's a choice,
it's obviously gonna be
Max Verstappen, isn't it?
[crowd cheering]
[Croft] For the final time in 2018...
[engines roaring]
we're racing!
Max Verstappen,
what happened to him off the line?
[Verstappen] Engine hot. Engine hot.
[Croft] Verstappen is down in tenth place,
down at turn one.
[man] Oh, come on!
[Croft] Going wide there
is Romain Grosjean...
Alonso has been crowded out too.
[Alonso] Very low grip, but I will push
the tires to the limit.
[Croft] Very good start by Nico Hülkenberg
in the Renault.
[Slade] Doing a great job, Nico.
Push like hell.
[Slade] Are you okay, Nico?
Nico?
[Hülkenberg]
Holy shit. I'm hanging here like a cow.
- [Slade] Yeah.
- Get me out. There's fire. There's fire.
[Grosjean] Is he okay?
[Hülkenberg]
What happened there, anyway?
[Slade] Main thing is you're safe, Nico.
[Hülkenberg] Who was that?
[Slade] I think it might be one
of the Haases, Grosjean.
[Grosjean] Hey, where did he think
he was going? Just turned into me.
[Brundle] Grosjean was
in the blind spot of Nico Hülkenberg.
Romain Grosjean did nothing wrong there.
[Hülkenberg] The car landed on the roof.
In that moment, I thought, like,
"Shit, you know... That's it. I'm out."
I couldn't get out of the car.
I saw fire and, you know,
got some smoke and fumes.
It's not so nice to breathe them.
It happens, and normally,
you check, yup, everything's still there,
brush it off and you move on.
- [Lambiase] Max, okay...
- [Verstappen] Man, engine hot. Fuck!
[Lambiase] Cool the car, please, Max.
Cool it.
That should help the engine.
[Verstappen] Yeah, I'm fucked.
[Croft] And Verstappen losing power
with his engine overheating.
Down from sixth down to ninth.
His teammate, Daniel Ricciardo,
is in fifth place.
[Rennie] Daniel, let's buckle down.
Build up that rhythm again.
[Ricciardo] Understood.
[Verstappen]
What's going on with the engine?
[Lambiase] Okay, you've done
a good job cooling the engine, Max.
- Continue to stay out.
- Can we use more power?
Yeah. Engine is fine.
Let's chop through this traffic.
[Croft] Max Verstappen in the hunt
for teammate Ricciardo.
Perez ahead of Verstappen,
and he might fancy a go here,
and he does.
[cheering]
[Lambiase] Well done, Max.
That is Ocon ahead of you.
Be sensible.
[Croft] Verstappen's got the inside line!
Into Esteban Ocon he goes.
[cheering]
[Joyce] So don't waste time
with Verstappen.
[Croft] Daniel Ricciardo third
and Max Verstappen up into fourth place.
[laughing]
[tires squealing]
[Croft] Daniel Ricciardo needs to look
at his wing mirrors.
His teammate, Max Verstappen,
is closing in on him.
Daniel, that lap you went 44.5,
Verstappen, 44.0.
- The gap now 1.5 behind.
- Okay. Yeah.
[Croft] Max is still fighting for third
in the Drivers' Championship.
[Lambiase] So box and pit it, Max.
Box, pit it.
[Verstappen] Yep. Yeah.
[Croft] So, Verstappen
getting the early call.
Going then onto a brand-new set of tires.
[tools whirring]
Ricciardo's ahead of Verstappen
on the track,
but Verstappen,
he might be on the better strategy.
[Brundle] I don't think Red Bull
are too worried
about pleasing Daniel Ricciardo anymore.
He's off to Renault, isn't he?
[Croft] Here comes Fernando Alonso
on Sergei Sirotkin,
down the inside.
Fernando Alonso
in his final Formula One race.
[Joseph] There's a point here
for grabs, mate.
There's a point here for grabs.
Let's go get him. Let's go get him.
[Alonso] I have 1,800 points.
[Joseph] Well, for me, make it 1,801.
[Croft] Ricciardo and Verstappen
running third and fourth.
The gap between Ricciardo
and Max Verstappen is twelve seconds.
[Rennie] Daniel, box in this lap. Box.
Daniel, box. Box this lap.
[whirring]
[Croft] Daniel Ricciardo will come out
behind his teammate, Max Verstappen,
and the chase now is on.
[Rennie] Daniel, Verstappen will be
about eight seconds ahead.
[commentator]
They've just shafted Daniel Ricciardo
with that early pit-stop from Max.
- Max, Daniel has now pitted.
- Yeah.
Daniel is up 2.7 seconds
of Verstappen ahead.
He's gonna be fighting with Bottas.
You're gonna join the party quite soon
at this pace.
[Croft] Oh, that's clever by Verstappen.
[banging]
Put Valtteri Bottas
off the track as well.
[Verstappen] He just didn't see me.
[cheering]
[Croft] Now, Ricciardo is right on
the rear wing of Bottas.
[Rennie] Okay, mate, you know what to do.
Let's have it.
[Croft] Last of the late breakers,
Daniel Ricciardo puts himself up
into fourth place.
And the Red Bulls are really going
for it here.
[crew cheering]
[Croft] The final few laps of 2018...
And once again, the Red Bulls
are right together.
Just 1.6 seconds between them.
Daniel Ricciardo has just set
the fastest lap of the race,
but it's not enough.
[Lambiase] And final lap, Max. Final lap.
[Croft] Max Verstappen
finishes on the podium for Red Bull.
- [Lambiase] Nice end to 2018, mate.
- [Verstappen] Yes! Oh, yes!
[laughs]
[Horner] Max has driven brilliantly.
I think what he showed this year,
more than anything,
was his strength of character,
which, in this business, is everything.
[Croft] Daniel Ricciardo,
a couple of seconds adrift
in his final race for the team
before he moves to Renault.
[Horner] Daniel, great drive today.
And yeah, we're gonna miss you.
Um... we wish you all the very, very best
for the future, and, uh...
hold very fond the memories
that we have together,
so enjoy this slow-down lap.
[Ricciardo]
Thank you. Thank you, Christian.
I feel I'm applying myself every race,
but things keep happening
out of my control,
so that's been the frustrating thing.
I just wanna do well. I wanna win.
[Croft] Carlos Sainz holds off
the challenge of the rest
to finish sixth in this race.
[Loos] Awesome job. P-6.
[Sainz] Whoo! Come on, boys.
That's how you finish in style.
[Croft] Fernando Alonso, who drove
for Ferrari
and drove once alongside Lewis Hamilton,
joins the number one
and number two this season
in a display...
a really nice touch.
I think the sport will miss him.
We will miss him. A true legend.
Well done. Thanks very much. Good job.
[Horner] We're third in the Constructors.
I think it's been
a very solid year for us.
But it's a huge gap
that we've got to bridge
between ourselves
and Ferrari and Mercedes.
The Renault engine,
they haven't delivered.
Moving to Honda...
Honda have the right resources,
the right commitment,
the right desire and ambition
to win in Formula One.
We want to win.
[Hülkenberg] We were the fourth best team.
Beat all the other midfield teams.
And obviously, next year,
we're looking for the next step.
Ah.
[Abiteboul] Moving forward, we need
to gain confidence that our ambition
to become the top team
and fight with the best...
is credible.
Daniel, we're expecting from him
that he will contribute
to the construction of the team.
[Ricciardo] Moving to Renault,
I'm expecting more for myself.
I want to have a presence in the team,
figure out the best way to really
bring the team to that next level.
Yeah, hopefully it works for me
in the next few years,
um, but certainly, uh, yeah,
I'm curious to know what else is out there
and how I can keep bettering myself.
I guess searching for more from me.
- You're gonna keep entertaining us?
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
[chuckles] Okay.
[Hülkenberg]
Daniel, he arrives to a new team.
Him coming in,
I wanna do well for the team,
but of course,
I also wanna beat my teammate.
[man] It's a bit of a squeeze, no?
[reporter] Christian,
if we could come to you, please.
You're losing two things
after this weekend.
Renault and Daniel Ricciardo.
Yeah. I mean, slightly awkward,
'cause I'm sitting next to Cyril,
who's taking, obviously,
both elements after the weekend.
Um... uh...
I mean, Cyril was making the tea
when we first started with Renault.
And, uh...
- He's always nice.
- And it's had his ups and downs.
[Abiteboul] We'd like to challenge
Red Bull, obviously.
That would be fun,
because otherwise I'm not sure
what Red Bull will be talking about,
now that they can't blame
the French partner anymore.
Cyril, bridging the gap
to the other three big teams,
what are your expectations?
Your hopes?
[clears throat] Well, you need to expect
from us that we keep on progressing
and completing
the construction of the team,
and we expect Daniel
to play a key role in that.
It's in our hands to deliver
the best possible result for the company.
Cyril, you know, he is also
under pressure, obviously,
from the Renault board to show results.
[Stoll] Our ambition
is to be on the podium.
And now we are just
so close to the podium...
that I'm sure that next year
we can do that.
[woman] Now they're asking me
to slow you slightly down.
Just walk in a more relaxed way.
Just slower.
Full McLaren pace?
[laughing]
Just a little bit slower.
I want to be fast
at least once this year.
I think Formula One
has been amazing to me.
But it's the right time to to move on.
To the two-times world champion,
Fernando Alonso!
[cheering]
[Brown] We knew the day would come
that Fernando wouldn't always
be in our race car.
You know, life goes on.
You know, it's been
a pleasure working alongside him.
We've closed the chapter on '18,
and now super excited for '19.
As soon as I saw
the McLaren opportunity opening up,
I also had no doubt
and I went for McLaren.
I feel so motivated and so happy
after this last race
showing what I was capable of doing
that I go into McLaren tomorrow morning
already into the box
and I'm preparing the test,
I'm preparing next season.
Maybe take a couple of days
off, though, yeah?
I don't need to. I'm... I'm ready.
[Brown] I've known Carlos for some time.
He's very fast.
A bit of a killer behind the wheel.
Commercially, the sponsors like him.
He's a handsome Formula One driver.
Without talent,
you cannot drive these cars.
It's as simple as that.
[Croft] Sainz has pulled out
from behind the slipstream.
[crew cheering]
[Croft] Nice move there!
Carlos Sainz, fifth place.
[Sainz] I feel privileged and lucky
to be one of those 20
that knows that I'm quite talented.
It's a totally new driver lineup
for McLaren in 2019.
I'm Lando Norris...
and I'm the youngest ever
Formula One British racing driver.
To be announced as the 2019 McLaren
race driver, it's a dream come true.
- Congratulations, first and foremost.
- Thank you.
- Who is the first person you told?
- Um, my mom.
[laughing]
- Think you're ready for this challenge?
- Certainly.
- Hi, nice to meet you. Congratulations.
- How are you? Thank you.
Well, you're obviously 18 years old.
Have you passed your test?
I have...
And I've got a few points on my license.
- What for?
- Speeding.
[woman] They're never going to let you
forget that... ever.
[Norris] I've always wanted to be
a part of McLaren since I was very young.
Every year, I've basically taken
a step up into the next category.
From Formula Four
all the way to Formula One now.
[Brown] I think Lando
will be awesome talent.
uh, statistically,
one of the best junior drivers ever.
Coffee's not allowed in here.
He certainly has the CV that would
suggest he's a future world champion.
I think I'm being partnered
with Carlos for next year.
It's very exciting.
[Brown] The two of them
is gonna be a great pairing.
The youngest pairing on the grid,
youngest pairing McLaren's ever had.
[man] Lando, you're the latest
young driver to come into McLaren.
We've seen Sergio Perez.
We saw Kevin Magnussen,
We saw Stoffel Vandoorne.
- They've all gone within two years.
- Yeah.
Are there any concerns
about following that kind of pattern?
Nope, because I'm better.
[chuckles]
We're taking some risk there,
but we think it's the right decision.
[Buxton] In one sense, it's a risk.
In another, if it pays off,
he'll look like a genius.
- Good job.
- Thank you.
- It's a good season. Good job.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you, chaps.
If someone would've told me a year ago,
in Abu Dhabi, "Next year, you're fifth,"
would I have signed on for it? Sure.
All right, I just want to say
you all can be proud of what
you achieved, guys, you know.
[Steiner] I think we never have to forget,
we are only in our third season,
and to achieve this is pretty good.
I don't know how many times this was done
as such a young team.
The challenge we didn't get to
is we didn't finish fourth, guys.
We had races
where we could have done more.
- I don't think that's tight.
- [Magnussen] Failure, guys.
One of our drivers in the first part of
the season had a few crazy moments.
If we don't make mistakes, we don't learn.
We had so much ups and downs.
It's quite amazing,
you know, how we got through this.
Do not be downbeat about this,
because we didn't achieve fourth.
You can be proud.
We can just get stronger, you know.
Thank you very much, guys.
Thank you. Thank you.
The goals for next season will be
to just continue on this
and better it, obviously.
We want to fight for fourth.
Guenther's made the decision to stick
with the driving line up
of Romain Grosjean
and Kevin Magnussen in 2019.
- Good job.
- Thank you.
Thanks for the season.
Thank you.
This year has been pretty consistent
from my side,
and I've scored points
at many different tracks
and at many races,
so I'm pretty satisfied.
Being able to come back
from a difficult start,
it takes a lot of energy.
It's a lot of pride as well.
People were thinking,
you know, you were done.
Now I want to keep that good form
and not get into that deep again.
[Medland] Grosjean looks
like he's sorted out those problems,
but if he hasn't, then that's gonna
really hurt Haas next season.
Yeah. You... You stink. You stink.
[laughing]
[Medland] Then you've got to look
at who made the decision
to stick with the lineup.
[Croft] There's only 110 days to go
until first practice in Melbourne.
There's this false perception
that after Abu Dhabi,
oh, you go on holiday, you know,
that, "Enjoy your time off.
See you next season,"
and that we all turn up in Melbourne.
But actually, the factory
is working massively long hours,
Christmas is an inconvenience.
That's where the new car, the 2019 car,
is starting to come to life.
Formula One is addictive
and it draws you in.
The characters, the competition,
the drama, the theater,
the performance
of these spectacular machines,
and 2019 looks set to be a real classic.
[engines roaring]
[interviewer] If you could
just take a seat...
[Leclerc] Um... cool.
- Shots are quite tight, so...
- Okay.
See you, mate. Yeah. You're all right.
Make sure all the brands are...
- [interviewer] I'll be here. Talk to me.
- Yep.
Let's do the interview
and then see what time we got.
Are you continuing next year or not?
Have you decided?
- Like that?
- [interviewer]  Yeah. Yeah, that's good.
- That's perfect.
- [laughs]
You know I have
the worst memory in the world.
I feel like Snowden.
- So, am I looking at you?
- [interviewer] Yeah.
- [Verstappen] Are we filming?
- [man] We're filming.
- Okay.
- [man] We are in this episode.
[Verstappen] Cool.
[interviewer]
Do you mind just saying your name?
Like...
[interviewer] "My name's Charles Leclerc
and I drive for..."
Okay. Looking at the camera
or looking at you?
- No, look at me.
- Okay. My name is Charles Leclerc.
- I'm Pierre Gasly.
- I'm George Russell.
- I am Carlos Sainz.
- I'm Lance Stroll.
And I'm a Williams Racing F1 driver.
- I'm joining Ferrari.
- I'm joining McLaren.
I'm a Red Bull driver.
- It is a childhood dream.
- A huge honor.
I don't know. I mean,
can I confirm that I'm moving?
All the time I do something,
I wanna be the best.
It's incredible, no, how life is?
Career goal is to become Formula One
World Champion.
- World champion.
- It would definitely hit the spot.
To be honest, I don't think
they are even close to our level.
[chuckling]
You still need
a certain level of maturity.
You can talk as much as you want.
No hard feelings, I'm just looking ahead
to the ones we have to beat.
No, I didn't know.
What the hell? What was that?
A lot of people try to break your dreams.
- You can't please everyone.
- Obviously, the pressure is on.
There's always pressure.
You always try to do your best.
I'm very much looking forward to 2019.
We have to focus
on rebuilding this team.
Some teams will have got it right,
some teams will have got it wrong.
Ideally, I wanna be on top of Daniel.
- Priority is results.
- We can make the next step.
Race it and race it hard.
You know, I believe we can do better.
The aim is to become a world champion,
and of course, sooner than later.
The only thing we can do here,
wait and see.
- I can tell you, we've got lots coming.
- We're on our way.
Looking at me and Renault now,
that's all I'm interested in.
All right,
let's go fuck some shit up. [laughs]-Good.
-[interviewer] Yeah.
[interviewer] <i>Can you introduce yourself,</i>
<i>tell me what you do?</i>
[Binotto] <i>Okay.</i>
I'm Mattia Binotto.
I'm working at Scuderia Ferrari,
team principal, managing director.
[interviewer] So, have you got Netflix?
No.
-[interviewer] No?
-No.
-So, you haven't seen Season 1?
-No.
[commentator] <i>And there's a problem.</i>
<i>Massive accident!</i>
<i>Wow!</i>
[audience gasps]
[Steiner]<i> Last season...</i>
[commentator]
<i>What a performance from Haas.</i>
[Steiner] <i>...it was up and down.</i>
[commentator] <i>It's Grosjean!</i>
[all] Oh!
Fuck. We fucking look like
a bunch of wankers.
<i>But we made a big step up.</i>
[commentator] <i>Haas get their best-ever</i>
<i>finish in Formula 1.</i>
Woah!
[Brown] <i>At McLaren, I don't think</i>
<i>we designed a very good race car.</i>
[commentator] <i>Another problem for McLaren.</i>
<i>And Zak Brown, not happy.</i>
[Williams]<i> 2018 was a pretty horrific year</i>
<i>for Williams.</i>

[Ricciardo]
<i>I was kinda made to feel guilty.</i>
[commentator]
<i>Daniel Ricciardo leaving Red Bull.</i>
<i>He's going to Renault.</i>
[Abiteboul] You need a driver
and an engine.
[Abiteboul laughs]
[Horner]<i> Yeah.</i>
[Abiteboul] <i>With Daniel,</i>
<i>we have a strategy, we have a plan.</i>
[Ricciardo] <i>I just needed to get out.</i>
[commentator] <i>And the knock-on effects</i>

[Sainz Jr.] See ya.
[commentator] <i>It has been</i>

[Horner]<i> Mercedes is very much</i>

[commentator] <i>Lewis Hamilton,</i>

[Horner] <i>As one chapter closes...</i>
[Hamilton] <i>We have to focus</i>

[Magnussen]

I feel like I've been here before.
[dramatic music playing]
[upbeat music playing]
[man] Yeah.
-[Williams] Hello. Are you all right?
-[Abiteboul] <i>Bonjour.</i>
-[Abiteboul] Netflix.
-[Horner] Yes, of course.
[Horner] Are you guys back
for a second series?
-[woman] Yep.
-[Horner] Holy fuck.
[Norris] There's only one answer.
[Verstappen] I was sweating.
I was like, "No way. No way."
Down here, where you
and the drivers will be on the boat.
-[Williams] Yeah.
-[woman] Think they're gonna
go up the river a little bit and then...
Wave like the Queen?
[chuckles] Wave to the crowds.
[Williams] Hello. Hi.
[man] Whoo! Hello!
[woman] Hello, Melbourne.
Welcome to the very first
Formula 1 season launch.
Who wants to see their favorite
Formula 1 drivers here tonight?
[man] The drivers of 2019
Formula 1 World Championship field
-are about to arrive on the boat.
-[all cheering]
[woman] Drivers have arrived.
And I can spy Sebastian Vettel.
I can see Daniel Ricciardo as well.
[man] Daniel!
<i>I'm Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
I am driving with the Renault F1 team.
I'm still from Australia
and I'm still good looking.
[woman] Look, here they come.
George Russell. Lewis Hamilton.
[fan] Lewis, you legend!
I'm Lewis Hamilton
and I race for Mercedes-Benz.
-Shit, is that what it is?
-[man] Yeah.
-[man] Just say Mercedes-AMG.
-Yeah.
[man 1] Hey, the Hulk is here.
[man 2] Verstappen! Max! Max!
[Horner]<i> Well, we're all here because</i>
<i>we love racing, we love competing.</i>
<i>In many respects, it's my life.</i>
Outside of my family, it's the most
important thing in the world to me.
[woman] Hello, darling,
I have a present for you.
[Horner]<i> This is my 15th season</i>
<i>leading this team</i>
and I'm as excited going into this year
as I've been about any other years.
[crowd cheering]
[woman] If you want to,
otherwise I'll do it.
How is life?
Good, beginning of the season
so your dreams are still alive.
So far so good.
[Magnussen]
<i>The first race in Australia is awesome.</i>
<i>You know, you're excited to get back.</i>
I guess it's like, in spring,
when they let the cows out
of the houses and they go crazy.
[crowd cheering]
<i>My name's Toto Wolff.</i>
I'm the team principal of the Mercedes...
[in German] How do I say it?
Um...
[man] Valtteri!
So, my name's Valtteri Bottas.
I drive for the Mercedes-AMG
Petronas Motorsport.
[Wolff]<i> Like with everything in life, </i>
<i>you have to be passionate</i>
<i>about what you do.</i>
<i>For me, personally,</i>
it is about being able to add
a sixth consecutive championship.
That hasn't been done before.
[crowd cheering]
Where is he?
[crew] I'll send Sebastian
when he gets here.
Here he is. No, he's here.
<i>I'm Sebastian Vettel.</i>
I'm driving for Scuderia Ferrari.
<i>Well, obviously, I'm here</i>
<i>because I love racing, love my job,</i>
the goal and ambition
is to be successful with Ferrari,
and whilst doing so,
we enjoy and have a lot of fun.
[woman] Right.
Let's go down to the audience.
Who's got a question down there?
Put your hand in the air.
Here we go.
[man] My question's for Guenther.
After the race this year, do you aim
to look like wankers or rock stars?
Hopefully, rock stars.
-That was a good question.
-Good question.
[Steiner] Thank you for the question, sir.
<i>A lot of people know what</i>
<i>happened to us last year in Australia.</i>
[commentator] <i>Kevin Magnussen has pitted.</i>
We had two failures on the pit stops
and we retired both cars.
[commentator] <i>And who's that going slowly?</i>
<i>It's Kevin Magnussen.</i>
[commentator] <i>And by the looks of things, </i>
<i>one of those wheels</i>
<i>isn't attached properly.</i>
[Steiner] <i>Stop the car, stop the car.</i>
[commentator] <i>Romain Grosjean pulling over</i>
<i>in the other Haas!</i>
[Steiner] We fucking look
like rock stars, huh?
Now, we are a fucking bunch of wankers.
<i>Hopefully, we can make up for it</i>
<i>and that would be a good revenge.</i>
[Hamilton] <i>Each season is a journey.</i>
<i>It's 21 races, 21 countries.</i>
<i>On the road with us at Mercedes,</i>
there's nearly 100 people
that are moving from city to city.
<i>It's quite an incredible journey</i>
<i>in trying to win a world championship.</i>
And one I'm looking forward to.
We are doing pretty well.
We are in front of Alfa,
in front of one Ferrari.
Going to Melbourne, it's too early to say
who is good, who is not good.
<i>I'm not counting out anybody,</i>
<i>I mean, we are all in for it.</i>
Comparing with other cars,
it's always difficult the first days.
<i>Only the racetrack will tell.</i>
[Horner] <i>It's not really</i>
<i>till you get to Melbourne</i>
<i>that you absolutely know</i>
<i>where your starting point is.</i>
<i>It's the first time</i>
<i>everybody pulls down their pants.</i>
And you see what you've got.
[woman] We'll all do it together,
please, thank you.
[reporter] First, how does it feel
to be here with a different team?
[Ricciardo] Yeah, new team,
fresh start, fresh season,
but I still have
the same expectations for myself,
and to deliver, and to be the best I can
with the car I've got,
but also, I feel a real responsibility
to try and push this car further up
the gridduring my time here.
When I signed with Renault, a lot
of people probably didn't understand it.
<i>And maybe some still don't.</i>
No worries.
[Buxton] <i>No one saw it coming.</i>
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
Good luck for tomorrow.
[Buxton] <i>It was a massive, massive shock.</i>
-Any chance?
-Sure.
Right up until about a week
before it was announced...
Christian Horner was absolutely,
100% sure Daniel wasn't gonna go anywhere.
[Horner] <i>When he rang to say,</i>
<i>"I'm leaving to go to Renault,"</i>
first of all, I thought it was a wind up.
<i>He couldn't really give me any reason.</i>
<i>But with Max Verstappen as his teammate,</i>
<i>my assumption was that</i>
<i>he was running a little bit from a fight.</i>
[Ricciardo] <i>I, personally,</i>
<i>wasn't running from anything.</i>
<i>I still want to achieve the world title.</i>
<i>And to do that,</i>
<i>I just felt like I needed a change.</i>
[Driver] See you later. Take care.
[Ricciardo] Bye.
[Ricciardo] <i>Once I signed on</i>
<i>the dotted line last year,</i>
<i>moving to Renault,</i>
<i>working with new people...</i>
-Daniel.
-A pleasure.
[Ricciardo] <i>...it just increased every bit</i>
<i>of motivation and passion I had.</i>
I'll just wave to everyone.
Good morning!
-[man 1] Good morning!
-[man 2] Morning.
-[man 3] Welcome.
-Thanks.
[Ricciardo] <i>For sure, there,</i>
<i>I felt a bit of love.</i>
-Sup fellas?
-[man] Hey.
<i>That was the coolest thing.</i>
I noticed that straightaway,
everyone's just like...
Welcome.
[Ricciardo] <i>I wanna do great things here,</i>
and I wanna feel like this is a place
where I can, A, obviously be happy...
-Welcome home. You okay?
-Yeah.
[Ricciardo] <i>...but, B,</i>
<i>become a world champion.</i>
All right, this is it.
It's happening.
So, that's really all I'm here for.
[Ricciardo] What's going on?
Hiya.
[Abiteboul] So, welcome.
It's your office?
Yeah, it is, yeah, yeah. But...
We believed in him, um,
but also, he believed in us.
Um, it was a special moment.
[indistinct chatter]
So, this is...
-Race base, right?
-This is race base, yes.
-This is all the machining area.
-Okay.
So, I'll be working here?
This is this my desk?
-Yeah. This is where you'll sit. Yeah?
-Yeah.
And you can watch
the gearbox through the glass.
Cool.
[Abiteboul] <i>For Daniel to join us,</i>
<i>he was confirming our project was an</i>
<i>exciting project for him to be a part of.</i>
You know, I saw the momentum
they've had since 2016,
<i>and I think there was just pressure</i>
<i>to continue that for '19.</i>
It sounds busy,
so I like the sound of that.
[laughs]
Oh, I gotcha.
What we've done so far
is P9, P6, P4 into the championship
<i>over the last three years.</i>
So, I guess natural expectation
that the next step is P3.
Sorry, dude. Dude!
Excuse me.
[laughing]
Let's hug it out.
That's like the greatest,
greatest band ever.
Definitely.
Respect.
[laughs]
[Ricciardo] <i>If we, at Renault,</i>
<i>produce an amazing car</i>
<i>and really get ourselves clear</i>
<i>of that midfield,</i>
<i>and get in the fight</i>
<i>with those top three teams.</i>
<i>Ultimately, we want to latch onto</i>
<i>Ferraris, Mercedes and Red Bulls.</i>
Okay, so, let's give a big round
of applause to Daniel.
Please, thank you!
[all cheering]
[Ricciardo] <i>A first podium</i>
<i>with Renault, would...</i>
Well, I've thought about it.
I've certainly thought about it, but...
[crowd cheering]
[Abiteboul] <i>Welcome, Daniel.</i>
[commentator] <i>It's been a long wait,</i>
<i>but we're back everybody.</i>
<i>Welcome along to the first day</i>
<i>of the Formula 1 season.</i>
<i>We're here in Melbourne,</i>
<i>it's practice one.</i>
[engine accelerating]
[mechanic] Hello, how are you,
how have you been?
-When did you get here?
-Monday afternoon.
[Hamilton] <i>The ultimate goal is to win,</i>
<i>but we have to optimize this car.</i>
<i>We have to get this machine to perform.</i>
<i>It doesn't just perform on its own.</i>
<i>And the championship, it could be closer,</i>
I really won't know until we get
to that first race, to be honest.
-How are you?
-I'm good. All good?
[Horner] <i>Mercedes are a very</i>
<i>well-oiled machine.</i>
[Wolff] Hey, ladies.
You okay? You good?
They are, without a shadow of a doubt,
the favorites going into this year.
<i>And they will be</i>
<i>an incredibly hard nut to crack.</i>
[mechanic] So, the brakes, we need to go
and check that with George.
Sounds good.
[Wolff] Has everything with the setup
been okay with you?
Yeah, yeah, everything's been good.
Fire-up's gone all right. So far, so good.
-[Wolff] No dramas?
-[mechanic] Nope.
Engine running good, running well.
[Wolff] <i>We have brought ourselves </i>
<i>in a position that we</i>
<i>are the ones to beat.</i>
[Hamilton] <i>Radio check.</i>
[crew] Your radio's loud and clear, Lewis.
[Wolff] <i>A critical part is to manage</i>
<i>your own expectations.</i>
Not feel a sense of entitlement to win,
but stay modest,
<i>not looking back because at the start</i>
<i>of the season, all points go to zero.</i>
[crew] And Lewis, one minute.
[Binotto] <i>Last year,</i>
<i>we were a disappointed second.</i>
[both speaking in Italian]
[Binotto] <i>We are all very convinced</i>
<i>on what we wanna achieve.</i>
But again, it will take time.
The competitors are very strong.
[technician] Before turn nine,
upshift early
closer to when you go full throttle.
[Horner] <i>Well, Ferrari have dominated</i>
<i>pre-season testing.</i>
They will be blisteringly quick.
[crew] Radio check.
[driver] Copy.
[Binotto] <i>All the emotions are growing</i>
<i>because the car has to be</i>
<i>reliable to finish first,</i>
but we are working on that.
[indistinct chatter]
-You all right?
-[Verstappen] Yeah. Yeah, good.
Please, can it look like that
at the end of the session?
-Good.
-That would be nice.
Keep Olly, he's losing
a bit of hair these days.
He doesn't...
He doesn't need it accelerating.
[man] It's all ready,
whatever happens, we're ready.
[Horner] <i>Max very much moves into</i>
<i>the driver to lead the team.</i>
<i>He started to select</i>
<i>another gear last year.</i>
<i>And he has this growing following,</i>
<i>this growing intensity around him.</i>
[Buxton] <i>Ever since</i>
<i>he signed for Red Bull,</i>
Max has been the team's shining star.
Team management has said
that they want to turn him into
the youngest world champion
in this sport's history.
So, competing with that, for Daniel,
was always going to be tough.
[interviewer] Will you miss Daniel,
racing him?
Daniel's in the paddock
and he's still racing Formula 1.
So, I won't necessarily miss him,
<i>but I'm just looking ahead</i>
<i>to the ones we have to beat</i>
<i>and those are Ferrari and Mercedes,</i>
<i>not Renault.</i>
That's the target.
You know, if you see
that helmet in your mirror,
he's not gonna be there for long
and he's definitely gonna have a go,
<i>and it's reminiscent of</i>
<i>the greats in the past.</i>
<i>He will not give up</i>
<i>and will give it absolutely everything.</i>
[Verstappen] <i>Well, for me the aim</i>
<i>is to become a world champion</i>
<i>and, of course,</i>
<i>it's always better sooner than later.</i>
<i>In 10, 15, 20 years' time,</i>
if I would look back and I see third,
I'm not really interested.
But, personally, I'm only there to win.
[Horner] <i>We gotta deliver to retain him.</i>
<i>He's got an agreement with the team</i>
<i>that if we don't fit the criteria</i>
<i>by the summer break,</i>
<i>which is top three</i>
<i>in the Drivers' Championship, </i>
<i>then he's a free agent.</i>
<i>And there's a lot of teams in the paddock</i>
<i>that would like to sign up Max Verstappen.</i>
<i>Our intention is to provide him with a car</i>
<i>to be able to challenge</i>
<i>for the world championship.</i>
[announcer speaking Japanese]
[engine accelerating]
[crowd cheering]
[announcer speaking Japanese]
[announcer] Please welcome.
[Horner] <i>Coming into 2019, </i>
<i>the biggest strategic decision</i>
<i>that we've had to make</i>
was walking away from Renault and taking
on a largely unproven engine in Honda.
Well, the missing link for us
the last five years
has really been the power unit.
Um, you know, we went from winning
four double world championships.
The last five years
have been difficult for us.
[Horner] <i>We're totally taking</i>
<i>a risk on Honda, you know.</i>
You know, we've gone to the casino.
We've put all our money on one number.
[announcer speaking Japanese]
[Verstappen] <i>It's not like some</i>
<i>other sports where it's just yourself,</i>
which can make the difference.
<i>If you don't really have</i>
<i>a car where you can fight with,</i>
then you can't really show
how good you are.
<i>At the moment for me,</i>
<i>it's very difficult to say what we can do,</i>
<i>because you don't know.</i>
Nobody knows.
[Horner] <i>The reality is Red Bull</i>
<i>make an energy drink worldwide.</i>
Formula 1 is a platform
to promote and advertize it.
[commentator] <i>Max Verstappen!</i>
[crowd applauding]
[Horner] If this new relationship
with Honda doesn't work,
<i>if we lose Max Verstappen,</i>
then you'd have to question Red Bull's
long-term commitment to Formula 1.
[commentator]<i> Time for qualifying.</i>
[engine accelerating]
[commentator] <i>Let's see the cars blast</i>
<i>around the Albert Park track.</i>
<i>It looks an absolute picture</i>
<i>in the sunshine on this beautiful evening.</i>
[Buxton] <i>Formula 1 hands out points</i>
<i>for the top ten drivers,</i>
with the winner getting 25,
second, 18, third, 15.
<i>Then it rapidly tails off.</i>
<i>So, if you're finishing lower than fifth,</i>
<i>you're not really scoring the points</i>
<i>that a top team needs</i>
<i>to fight for the championship.</i>
All you can do is get into the midfield.
[Grosjean] <i>To be fair,</i>
<i>everyone in the midfield</i>
<i>can be a good driver, you know.</i>
Can be Renault, can be McLaren,
<i>Alfa Romeo, Toro Rosso, or even Williams.</i>
<i>You never know, you know.</i>
-[engineer] Radio check, Romain.
-[Grosjean] It's good, brother.
I insulted. No, I don't insult you.
I insult him.
[Steiner] <i>A small team.</i>
<i>I compete with big manufacturers.</i>
We know that our opposition,
they have got bigger budgets.
<i>They've got more resources,</i>
<i>but it's not all about that.</i>
<i>We stand up to them</i>
<i>and I'm not afraid of them</i>
because we're actually
not afraid of anybody.
[Steiner] You know we are going
into our fourth season.
I think we will have a good year again.
It's a joy to work with you.
With some of you. Not with everybody.
Where's Romain?
Nothing to say. Good.
Yeah, I need somebody to pick on.
It's normally him. He's used to it.
[Steiner] <i>We rock a little bit</i>
<i>the establishment...</i>
[laughing]
[Steiner] ...<i>which I think</i>
<i>a lot of people like.</i>
Let's go and see the car a moment,
guys. Let's come over.
[Steiner] <i>The doubters will be</i>
<i>always out there.</i>
What do you think, guys?
Good, little bit different, huh?
Hopefully, it's fast.
<i>I don't really care about what they say.</i>
You have to cut out
the BS from these people
because they've all got an opinion,
but they don't do the job.
Romain, the last time a black and gold car
was on the grid,
it finished on the podium with you, yeah.
So can you repeat this, yeah?
-[Grosjean] No pressure. No pressure.
-[Steiner] Yeah, no pressure...
Well, we went bankrupt as well.
We are not bankrupt. We are not bankrupt.
You know, we're not bankrupt.
Anyway, not yet.
Depends how many cars
you destroy this year but, so...
That was going to come.
[Steiner] It's time now
to get on the podium, huh?
[Grosjean] I see.
[Steiner] Are you upset now with me?
This was a joke.
[rock music playing]
[music continues]
[commentator]
<i>Lewis Hamilton on pole position.</i>
<i>Romain Grosjean starts sixth for Haas,</i>
<i>ahead of Kevin Magnussen.</i>
[Steiner] If it stays like this,
we are fine.
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>the Australian hero.</i>
<i>What can he do from 12th?</i>
[commentator] <i>What of Red Bull?</i>
<i>Can they take the fight</i>
<i>to the reigning world champions?</i>
[Gasly] <i>Radio okay?</i>
[Verstappen] <i>Radio check.</i>
[crew] <i>Copy, loud and clear.</i>
[commentator] <i>Just moments to go before</i>
<i>the start of the Australian Grand Prix.</i>
[commentator]
<i>It's lights out and away we go!</i>
[engines accelerating]
[commentator] <i>And Daniel Ricciardo losing</i>
<i>his front wing going into turn one.</i>
[commentator] <i>There's a Renault</i>
<i>front wing missing.</i>
<i>They didn't even get past</i>
<i>the end of the pit lane.</i>
[Ricciardo] <i>Has it come off completely?</i>
[crew] <i>Affirm.</i>
<i>Yep, has come off completely.</i>
<i>Boxing this lap for nose change.</i>
[Ricciardo] <i>Understood.</i>
[commentator] <i>A fairly troublesome start</i>
<i>then for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
[commentator] <i>And Ricciardo</i>
<i>running plum last.</i>
[crew] <i>Okay, let's find a rhythm now.</i>
<i>It's going to be a long one.</i>
[Ricciardo] <i>I've picked up</i>
<i>a pretty big vibration.</i>
[crew] <i>Okay, Daniel.</i>
<i>We're going to box this lap, please.</i>
<i>We have an issue.</i>
<i>We're gonna retire the car.</i>
<i>Sorry about that, mate.</i>
[Ricciardo] <i>Sorry it didn't work out.</i>
[commentator] <i>That is a very,</i>
<i>very disappointing end</i>
<i>to one of his happiest weekends</i>
<i>of the season.</i>
[engine accelerating]
[engineer] <i>Okay, Romain,</i>
<i>let's keep pushing,</i>
<i>keep pushing and pressurizing other cars.</i>
[Grosjean] <i>Okay.</i>
[commentator]
<i>Grosjean goes down the inside!</i>
[engine accelerating]
[commentator] <i>Haas think</i>
<i>they've got a very fast car.</i>
[Grosjean] <i>Yeah, told you</i>
<i>the car was good. Fuck yeah.</i>
[crew] <i>Okay, Romain, let's push</i>
<i>as hard as we can.</i>
<i>Good job, dude. Good job.</i>
<i>Box, Romain.</i>
[Grosjean] <i>Okay.</i>
[engine whirring]
[commentator] <i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>Not another pitstop drama</i>
<i>for Haas in Australia.</i>
[crew] <i>We're still in this fight, dude.</i>
[Grosjean] <i>Okay.</i>
[crew] <i>Okay, dude,</i>
<i>so you are around 1,5 seconds quicker</i>
<i>than the cars ahead.</i>
<i>We will catch them so let's keep going.</i>
[Grosjean] <i>I'm losing the brakes.</i>
<i>What's the situation, brother?</i>
[crew] <i>Stop the car, Romain.</i>
<i>Stop the car where you can.</i>
[car crashes]
[Grosjean] <i>Fuck!</i>
<i>Ahh! Fucking stupid, fucking stupid.</i>
[engine accelerating]
[commentator] <i>That's a shame.</i>
<i>He's done a great job this weekend.</i>
[Steiner] Fucking hell.
[commentator] <i>It's Mercedes first</i>
<i>and second, Ferrari third</i>
<i>and fourth. Red Bull fifth</i>
<i>with Max Verstappen.</i>
[engine accelerating]
[whistling]
[crew] <i>How much pace</i>
<i>do you think you've got in you?</i>
[Verstappen]
<i>I can easily pick up the pace.</i>
[commentator] <i>It's time to see</i>
<i>the real speed of that Honda engine.</i>
[commentator] <i>Into the pits comes Vettel.</i>
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>
<i>it's game on for Red Bull.</i>
[crew] <i>You just focus on getting Seb.</i>
[commentator] <i>Big cheers from the crowd!</i>
<i>You can hear them</i>
<i>as they see Verstappen closing in.</i>
[crew] <i>That's Vettel ahead of you.</i>
<i>Keep pushing.</i>
[Verstappen]
<i>We are definitely catching them.</i>
[crew] <i>Game on.</i>
[Verstappen] <i>Ah, yes.</i>
[commentator] <i>And there's Kevin Magnussen.</i>
<i>With Grosjean out of the race, all hopes</i>
<i>at Haas fall on him.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>Whatever position</i>
<i>I'm fighting for,</i>
I only have one setting
and that's maximum.
[commentator] <i>Now we'll see</i>
<i>whether Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>can hold off the Renault behind.</i>
<i>Magnussen defends his place.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[commentator] <i>You know what I've really</i>
<i>missed in the winter?</i>
<i>Max Verstappen going for some overtakes.</i>
<i>We start the final lap of this race.</i>
The whole car was coming alive.
<i>We seemed to have really good power</i>
<i>compared to the others,</i>
so I could basically just push flat out.
[commentator]<i> Verstappen's</i>
<i>going for it here.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen moves up into third place.</i>
[crew] <i>Yes, mate!</i>
[commentator] <i>This has been a brilliant</i>
<i>Australian Grand Prix!</i>
[commentator] <i>It's Valtteri Bottas who</i>
<i>wins the Australian Grand Prix.</i>
[commentator] <i>Hamilton across</i>
<i>the line in second.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen, for the first time ever,</i>
<i>will stand on the podium at Albert Park.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[commentator] <i>Ferrari finish fourth</i>
<i>and fifth, chased by Kevin Magnussen,</i>
<i>best of the rest, in sixth place,</i>
<i>putting Haas top of the midfield.</i>
[crew] <i>Chequered flag, Kevin,</i>
<i>chequered flag.</i>
<i>P6. Perfect race, man.</i>
<i>Perfect start to the season.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>Whoo-hoo! Ah!</i>
<i>Great job, guys. Great job, man.</i>
[all applauding]
[crowd cheering]
And they're finished!
Well done!
-Very happy, happy.
-First podium!
Thank you very much, thank you.
[crowd cheering]
[Verstappen] <i>I'm not a dreamer.</i>
<i>I want to achieve.</i>
I think everybody had
a lot of question marks
about the partnership
we were starting with Honda,
<i>but I believe that in the future,</i>
<i>we can win world championships again</i>
<i>like the past.</i>
[crowd cheering]
-Good one.
-Good job. At least one.
-50% better than last year.
-Yeah.
[chuckles] Getting there.
One more year and we're there again.
[Steiner] <i>It's such a mix of feelings,</i>
<i>but in the end you go away,</i>
<i>you make sure everyone is motivated</i>
<i>for the next race and you keep on going.</i>
[Grosjean] <i>It's one of 21,</i>
<i>and they're all part of one championship.</i>
The car is performing well. I feel good.
So, I'm ready to tackle the 20 others.
They actually showed your start.
They showed your start on the screen.
It's frustrating.
Your launch was awesome.
[Ricciardo] <i>It's a bit</i>
<i>of a kick in the guts</i>
<i>because it's just not</i>
<i>the way I wanted to start.</i>
<i>It does get you down.</i>
But the positive and the flip side is that
there's still so many races left,
so it's not like it's the last race
of the season
and you've got no more chance
at retaliation.
[Steiner] We are not going
to vote on this.
If somebody opposes to that, I sack them.
I wasn't even watching anymore.
I couldn't give a fuck.
[man]<i> It's gonna be a gearbox change.</i>
<i>Do you think we can do it or not?</i>
[crew 1]<i> Two minutes to go.</i>
[crew 2] <i>What happened?</i>
They hit each other.
[crew 2] Fuckin' idiots!
[Steiner] <i>I've had enough of both of you.</i>
<i>You let the fucking team down.</i>
<i>I don't need you here.</i>
-[man] Hello?
-Who the fuck are you?
You should have thrown
some banana peels at my rivals.
-Can you win this weekend?
-Yeah!
[Horner] <i>If they're good enough,</i>
<i>they swim. They survive.</i>
<i>If they're not good enough...</i>
[commentator]
<i>Max Verstappen goes off the track!</i>
[Sainz Jr.] <i>I'm working more</i>
<i>than anyone else in Formula 1.</i>
[man] We're gonna remove
that subject and put you in place.
<i>-No!</i>
-[Wolff] Let's crush them.
May the best man win.
[upbeat music playing]You're not mic'd up, are you?
-Yeah. Yeah, I don't care.
-Fuck it.
[chuckles]
-They take it out.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[Steiner] <i>The Haas F1 team</i>
<i>means a lot to me.</i>
Last year, we were fast...
[Croft] <i>Congratulations to Haas</i>
<i>for their best-ever finish in Formula 1.</i>
[Grosjean] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[Magnussen] Well done, guys.
You're with the big boys, yeah?
[Steiner] <i>Finishing fifth</i>
<i>in our third season</i>
<i>was a great achievement from the team,</i>
but we want to try to finish fourth
or better.
<i>This year, the pressure we are under</i>
<i>is very, very high.</i>
<i>If I have to remind you</i>
<i>to do your job every day,</i>
<i>you are in the wrong fucking place.</i>
<i>This is not a fucking kindergarten here.</i>
One little mistake
and you fail completely.
Obviously, it was
a little bit of a clown show today again.
We bitched about the tires enough
and we better
shut up, because otherwise
we look even bigger idiots than we are.
[Steiner] <i>Every weekend,</i>
<i>the tension is higher.</i>
As a team principal, you feel responsible
and I'm a little bit emotional.
Fucking hell!
I don't know what is fucking happening.
Fucking everything is fucked up
at the moment.
<i>There's always challenges.</i>
<i>You don't want them to be too brutal,</i>
<i>but you know they are coming.</i>
[Steiner] <i>Last season,</i>
<i>we made a big step upwards.</i>
<i>We know that our opposition,</i>
<i>they have got bigger budgets.</i>
<i>It's very difficult</i>
<i>to break into the top three.</i>
But nothing is impossible
if you've got enough money and resources.
My name's William Storey.
I'm the CEO and founder of Rich Energy.
This year, I put a personal guarantee down
for Haas for £35 million.
<i>They are a new business,</i>
<i>they're a little bit rock and roll,</i>
and they are Davids
taking on the Goliaths of motorsport.
We feel that we're the same
in the drinks business.
<i>We're supporting Haas</i>
<i>to become as successful as possible,</i>
and also having some fun along the way.
[Steiner] Good morning.
I don't know where I am, where to go.
I'm completely lost. I just follow you.
[woman] <i>Welcome to all of you here</i>
<i>for the Rich Energy Haas Livery Launch.</i>
We have a pretty exciting morning.
Stu, have you seen William?
It can only be a couple of minutes,
isn't it now?
-[Steiner] Do you live far from here?
-Two miles.
You could walk.
I could. [chuckles]
-It would be good for you.
-[Magnussen chuckles]
[Steiner] <i>For a small team like Haas,</i>
<i>we need to do a lot more with a lot less.</i>
So, we need a different model
to try to have success.
[camera shutters clicking]
[woman] Now, please welcome
the CEO of Rich Energy, William Storey.
[crowd cheering and clapping]
Wow! William, you are a popular bloke.
There's a lot of cheers
going on up there. [chuckles]
I paid them. Don't worry.
[all chuckle]
So it is time to see
what is under the covers.
[crowd cheering and clapping]
[Steiner] <i>In the beginning,</i>
we were questioned and critiqued
and doubted
<i>because nobody had done it.</i>
To be a team in Formula 1,
you have to be a constructor...
and that means you have to construct
every element of your car.
Haas was smart, though,
<i>because they bought in as many</i>
<i>off-the-shelf pieces as they could,</i>
to come into the sport
in a cost-effective manner
and essentially hit the ground running
as a competitive outfit.
[woman] So, what do you think?
-[Magnussen] Looks fast.
-[woman] Looks dangerous.
-[Magnussen] Looks angry.
-[chuckles] It does.
[Storey] <i>I think Haas</i>
<i>are a wonderful example of a team</i>
<i>who are much more efficient,</i>
<i>less profligate, brilliantly run.</i>
[Magnussen chuckles]
-[Storey] Nice suit.
-[Magnussen] It is, isn't it?
[Storey] Yeah.
I'm not sure I'd fit into that.
[both chuckle]
[Storey] <i>And as such,</i>
<i>I think they're starting</i>
to make some of the bigger teams
look a bit silly.
Having Rich Energy on board
as a title sponsor is a good thing for us.
<i>We get some more money</i>
<i>that will help us to move forward.</i>
Then hopefully get on the podium.
It's a good looking car,
so if it goes as good as it looks,
then we should be all right.
[chuckling] Yeah, we should be all right.
It doesn't always work like this.
Exactly.
-[crowd cheering]
-[engine revving]
[Croft] <i>It's the Australian Grand Prix</i>
<i>here in Melbourne.</i>
<i>In a very tight midfield pack,</i>
<i>Haas think they've got a very fast car.</i>
[Gannon] Good lap there.
Excellent pace.
<i>Chequered flag, Kevin. P6.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>Woo-hoo!</i>
[Gannon] <i>Perfect race.</i>
Good job, thank you.
[Magnussen] Car was amazing.
Let's keep this up and have a good season.
Well done, brilliant.
You did one fantastic move.
[reporter] Some say that you have cut the
gap to the top teams. Do you agree?
Let's wait a few races
to see where we really are.
[Croft] <i>Lance Stroll is going</i>
<i>to make contact with Romain Grosjean.</i>
[Grosjean] Ah! Fucking stupid!
[Croft] <i>The Haas team expected</i>
<i>a handful of points today,</i>
<i>and it's not really going</i>
<i>that well at all.</i>
[Grosjean] I'm losing the brakes.
<i>Grosjean lights up his tires,</i>
<i>takes to the escape road.</i>
<i>He might have to be coming</i>
<i>into the pits again very shortly.</i>
[engineer] Romain,
we need to retire the car.
[Grosjean] Okay.
[Steiner] Fucking hell!
[Gannon] <i>Remember, mode push.</i>
[Croft] <i>Kevin Magnussen. Big accident.</i>
[clattering]
-[Gannon] Are you okay?
-[Magnussen] Yeah.
[Brundle] <i>They can't find</i>
<i>a race setup for these tires at Haas.</i>
[Gannon] Things look okay data-wise.
[Magnussen] It feels strange.
There's no grip.
[Croft] <i>Kevin Magnussen's two laps down.</i>
<i>He's running in 18th place.</i>
[Steiner] <i>I don't get it.</i>
<i>They overtake us everywhere.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>This is the worst experience</i>
<i>I’ve ever had in any race car, ever.</i>
[Steiner] <i>For us, it's also not</i>
<i>a nice experience. Enough now.</i>
Everything seems to be going
in the right direction, so...
<i>Front row on the grid.</i>
[Steiner] <i>The last two or three races</i>
<i>were very bad for us.</i>
[crowd shouting indistinctly]
[Steiner] <i>It doesn't seem</i>
<i>that we can get on top of it.</i>
<i>Coming here in Austria,</i>
<i>we need to work hard</i>
<i>and try to come up with a solution</i>
<i>to our problems.</i>
You can come closer,
so I have to shout less.
Are we all... Geoff? Doorman?
Are we all here? All right.
Coming from fifth now
to being ninth in the championship,
it's not a good feeling,
I can tell you guys.
I'm embarrassed about it.
I don't like this feeling.
I cannot deal with that,
and as a team, we never had this,
and I'm not saying
that you're not working hard, guys.
But in general,
we all have to look into the mirror,
and see what can we do better,
what have we missed?
There is a lot to be done.
We are here to fight
and get back where we want to be.
Our aim is still to finish fourth
in the championship, you know,
which is still possible
because we're not that far out.
Thank you very much, guys.
[all clapping]
[engineer] Good morning
to everybody in the garage.
[Magnussen] <i>You go into the weekend</i>
<i>with expectations and you're pumped.</i>
<i>But then, as soon as it goes bad,</i>
<i>you start just feeling nervous and tense.</i>
[engineer] <i>Radio check</i>
<i>on the race channel.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>Radio's good.</i>
[Gannon] <i>Fire up, please.</i>
[engineer] <i>Green light.</i>
[engine revving]
[Gannon] Charge on.
[Magnussen] I had so much understeer
in that corner there.
I mean, it doesn't feel fantastic.
We've been struggling for pace
a little bit this whole year
and the car just isn't working.
<i>We don't actually really know</i>
<i>exactly what is our problem.</i>
<i>So, we need to look at everything</i>
<i>and question everything.</i>
<i>It's a pretty tough situation.</i>
[sighs heavily]
The car wouldn't turn any more.
That was the big issue.
The biggest problem this year
is the performance of the car, generally,
which is quite poor.
It's not controllable.
[Steiner] <i>The car was</i>
<i>very good in Melbourne.</i>
<i>And then, the other teams</i>
<i>kept on moving forwards.</i>
<i>But we didn't make any progress.</i>
[Komatsu] Yes, a lower speed, basically.
Low speed, as usual.
[Buxton] <i>Every weekend,</i>
<i>the teams refine their cars,</i>
trying to get more speed in the battle
with your nearest competitor.
The Haas upgrades have not been working.
Part and parcel of it
may be to do with the business model.
Getting a lot of parts in,
<i>putting the car design and manufacture</i>
<i>out to third parties.</i>
So, the team needs to get on top
of what the core issue is.
[Komatsu] Anyone else?
Okay, thank you.
[indistinct chatter]
[Steiner] Got a minute?
[Komatsu] I always have a minute.
[Steiner] I'll show you.
This is the official speeds.
I don't get it.
The car was not a piece of shit.
So why did we develop a car
which fucking goes slower?
Find out the problem
and make progress out of it,
instead of, "This is better." It isn't!
"This is better." It fucking isn't.
I want to see the progress.
I mean, otherwise,
I'll make changes, you know?
<i>Whatever happens, I'm responsible</i>
<i>to the owner of our team, Gene Haas.</i>
[chuckling] <i>Let's hope he doesn't</i>
<i>get frustrated too much.</i>
[clears throat]
Can we have two cappuccinos?
-[waitress] Yeah.
-Thank you.
-[Steiner] Thank you.
-[waitress] You're welcome.
[Haas] So, it seems like
our biggest problem
is keeping the cars
with their initial speed.
-Thank you.
-[waitress] No problem.
'Cause it seems like
it falls off way too fast.
And the drivers just wave
to everybody as they go by.
[clears throat]
You have to rely too much on the data.
We've got a lot of data,
but we still run like dog shit.
-Sometimes.
-It can't get any slower than we're going.
We just need to figure out
a few things,
not to make mistakes, and we're good.
Hope you get it fixed.
-You're telling me.
-Yeah.
-Well, every weekend's a new test.
-Yeah, every weekend's a new day.
Let's see if you can pass this one.
[machines whirring]
[Haas] <i>Well, in the season so far,</i>
<i>we're the ones that have been struggling,</i>
<i>which is not good.</i>
<i>It pissed me off, that's for sure.</i>
[Steiner]<i> Gene Haas is supporting us.</i>
<i>But he needs to see</i>
<i>if it is still worthwhile</i>
<i>for Haas Automation to invest in the team.</i>
[engine revving]
[Croft] <i>So, here we go.</i>
<i>Time for qualifying.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[Gannon] Okay, charge on.
Kevin, slow the car. We have an issue.
Something went wrong in the gearbox.
<i>I'll tell you now</i>
<i>that it doesn't look good.</i>
<i>Okay, it's gonna be a gearbox change.</i>
[Magnussen] I'm sorry. It sucks, man.
[Steiner] I cannot believe it.
[Magnussen] It's all right. We'll get it.
[Steiner chuckling] Yeah, we'll get it.
[commentator] <i>Under Formula 1 rules,</i>
<i>Magnussen will have to take</i>
<i>a five-place grid penalty</i>
<i>for changing the gearbox.</i>
[Steiner]<i> The gearbox has gone.</i>
One race old.
They have to take it out now
and change it.
It was new on the last race,
so now we get a penalty.
We cannot get one right
at the moment, for fuck's sake.
[commentator] <i>Haas are</i>
<i>up against the clock.</i>
<i>They need to get their car ready</i>
<i>and out on track</i>
<i>before the end of qualifying.</i>
[engineer] <i>Uh, it's a little</i>
<i>over 15 minutes to go.</i>
[Komatsu] Do you think
we can do it or not?
[mechanic] We can try.
Yeah, I'm sorry
we've got a five-place penalty,
but we still can do a good lap time.
[engineer] <i>Ten minutes to go.</i>
<i>Ten minutes.</i>
[Steiner] Here we are again.
The new gearbox. Let's see if it works.
[Haas] Think this one's any better
than the last one?
Should be.
It's a new one.
[engineer] <i>Two minutes to go.</i>
[machines whirring]
<i>One minute to go. One minute.</i>
<i>Green light.</i>
[Gannon] <i>Fire up, please.</i>
[Steiner] <i>Keep it up, guys, we can do it.</i>
[engineer]<i> Okay, let's go.</i>
[engine revs]
[engineer] <i>Chequered flag.</i>
Very good lap.
[Magnussen] <i>How's that?</i>
[engineer] <i>P5.</i>
[Magnussen laughing] <i>Woo-hoo!</i>
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>Fucking love that.</i>
<i>Ah, I can't believe this.</i>
-[team cheering]
-[engineer] Wow.
Unreal!
Fuckin' amazing, guys, amazing.
Good job. Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
[both speaking indistinctly]
[Steiner]<i> Expectations of Gene Haas</i>
<i>is always to do better.</i>
[Haas] Let's do that without the penalty.
Yeah, fucking hell, five.
[Steiner] <i>I would say</i>
<i>it's never good enough.</i>
<i>Kevin did magic there.</i>
<i>I mean, it was a fantastic lap,</i>
<i>his last lap.</i>
So, lot of people said we are history
and now we will be last this year.
We will keep fighting.
-Well done, mate.
-[Magnussen] Motherfuckin' ten!
[Steiner] <i>We showed that</i>
<i>we are a strong team.</i>
<i>We just need to be confident,</i>
<i>focus on your job.</i>
<i>If everybody does that, we are back.</i>
[Steiner] <i>As a team principal,</i>
<i>you are judged every weekend you race.</i>
<i>You do good or you do bad.</i>
<i>Yeah, you can do okay,</i>
<i>but okay is already bad.</i>
[engine revving]
[Magnussen] <i>When I qualified fifth,</i>
<i>I was so happy about that performance.</i>
[engineer] One minute to go.
Everything goes from being
a little bit hopeless to being possible.
<i>We really need a good one</i>
<i>to lift everyone up,</i>
<i>and get the belief back into the team.</i>
[Steiner] <i>We have done our best.</i>
<i>But it's out of your control.</i>
[beeping]
[engine revving]
[commentator] <i>We're racing in Austria.</i>
[Gannon] Mode push, Kevin.
[Steiner] I don't understand it.
There's something wrong.
[Magnussen] <i>I'm losing rear grip.</i>
[Gannon] <i>Okay, Kevin, overheating is high.</i>
[Steiner] It's weird.
[Gannon] <i>Overheating very high.</i>
[Magnussen]<i> Really struggling.</i>
[Gannon] Overheating is the highest
it's ever been.
<i>We'll figure something out.</i>
<i>We just got to get these temps</i>
<i>calmed down.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>Come on, do something.</i>
[Steiner] We are overheating.
We are slow.
Everybody else
is not overheating and fast.
[Grosjean]<i> Previous lap,</i>
<i>balance was all over the place.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[Grosjean] <i>Is everything okay on the car?</i>
[engineer]<i> Okay, we'll investigate.</i>
[Steiner] One of the problems is,
on the straight, we are so slow.
We are just fighting.
[Grosjean] <i>I feel like it's raining.</i>
<i>I've got no grip.</i>
[engineer] We need to move
to the side to cool the car.
[Grosjean] <i>No difference.</i>
<i>I don't know how much longer</i>
<i>I'll be able to stay out.</i>
[commentator] <i>Grosjean is definitely</i>
<i>having issues with his car.</i>
<i>He's now down to 17th place.</i>
<i>Whatever is wrong with that Haas,</i>
<i>the race pace has just disappeared.</i>
<i>And Magnussen is dropping down the field</i>
<i>once again.</i>
<i>He's now back in 14th place.</i>
[Steiner] It's annoying, Ayao.
It's like there's no point to sit here.
[commentator] <i>Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>loses another position.</i>
<i>He just has no pace.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>Being overtaken all the time,</i>
<i>it just feels so hopeless.</i>
[Gannon] <i>Chequered flag, Kevin.</i>
Tough race, dude.
We just didn't have the pace
in either car today.
[commentator] <i>That's another day</i>
<i>of pain for Haas</i>
<i>with Grosjean finishing 16th</i>
<i>and Magnussen 19th.</i>
[Steiner] <i>When you have a bad car,</i>
<i>it's difficult not to give up on it.</i>
[Grosjean]<i> Sorry, boys,</i>
<i>we couldn't do better.</i>
[Gannon] Obviously, we haven't solved it.
We will keep working.
[Magnussen] <i>Fucking hell.</i>
<i>I cannot do this.</i>
I might as well park the car
and jump out and go home.
[Steiner] Bad race for us.
Nothing more to say.
-Really?
-Yeah. Nothing.
I don't want to comment on it.
It's enough.
[cheering indistinctly]
[Steiner] Fucking hell.
Continuing like this is
banging our heads against a wall.
There's no point.
I mean, it hurts too much.
We aren't going anywhere.
The car was a fucking rocket before.
Is there something gone wrong?
There's something gone badly wrong.
[Grosjean] It's difficult
to be consistent.
-[Komatsu] Yeah.
-If you're on your own, it's okay.
[Komatsu] That's what I mean.
As soon as you're behind another car...
I don't want that one anymore.
[blows raspberry]
[Steiner] I don't fucking know.
I don't fucking... I don't fucking know.
[Grosjean] It was painful.
Oh. [scoffs]
I was just thinking what to do up there.
I wasn't even watching anymore.
I couldn't give a fuck.
We need to do something.
I mean, sitting here, at least you need...
-[Grosjean] It won't get better--
-[Steiner] No, it will not heal.
It's not like when you are scratched.
-It doesn't heal, this problem.
-No...
[Steiner] You need to do
something about it.
[Magnussen] <i>It's frustrating as hell.</i>
<i>I drive the car and then it doesn't work</i>
<i>and I'm like, "What's going on?"</i>
It's just refreshing
to just get away from it sometimes,
and, you know, disconnect from it.
<i>I'm getting into sailing quite a bit</i>
<i>and I just feel really switched off</i>
<i>when I go on the water.</i>
It's cool to think
that we could go anywhere right now.
-Fucking hell, I'm cold.
-[Carlsen chuckles]
[Magnussen] We're freezing our balls off.
[chuckling] So where
did you finish in Austria?
[laughs]
Well outside the points.
Well, I mean, just so good in qualifying,
and yeah, just no pace in the race.
I think everybody knows
what the problem is.
It's just... shit car.
[laughs]
Hopefully, they know
it's not just the drivers.
Being a driver, you feel pretty helpless
when it doesn't work.
It's been hard to understand
why we haven't been good.
We've actually been pretty terrible, so...
You could do the lap of your life
and then be 15th, still.
<i>And you start questioning everything,</i>
<i>including yourself.</i>
<i>Frustrations build up.</i>
<i>We're just running around in circles</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>
[Steiner] <i>At the moment, there's enough</i>
<i>going on and I need to deal with it.</i>
<i>It is very demanding.</i>
It's part of my life to come and go,
but I still like
to come back frequently here.
[Greta in German] Do you like
being team principal?
He has been doing it
for a long time. That's his job.
[Steiner] What else would I do?
[Gertraud] Make ice cream.
[Steiner] Ice cream.
[Steiner laughs]
[Steiner in English] <i>It's just</i>
<i>one setback.</i>
<i>It doesn't take me,</i>
<i>it doesn't take Haas F1 down.</i>
-[cashier in German] Thank you.
-Thank you.
[Steiner in English] <i>But a lot</i>
<i>of negative things came together.</i>
When he comes home,
usually, he is very quiet,
and I think that's the time
when he re-charges.
I mean, his job is constant pressure.
It's constant pressure,
so you think a lot about it.
That's for sure.
I actually don't suffer
the pressure itself.
It's more...
I would say I get emotional,
but the pressure
doesn't get to me, really.
Sometimes,
I think he drops off the pit wall.
[laughing]
I could picture it, you know.
Boom! Falls off.
[in German] What does Gene think?
At the moment, Gene is impatient
because we've had three good years,
and at the moment, it's not going as well,
when he always wants more success.
But I think we're in decent shape
and we'll get out of this hole.
I just hope it won't take too long
because it's tiring.
-Yeah.
-Tiring.
We also have trouble with the drivers
at the moment
Frustrating and...
There is this constant paranoia.
I think they always want to fight.
A driver wants to be in front.
I don't think they understand
what it's about.
They think it's only about them,
and you always need to think
about the team.
It can't go on like this.
[imperceptible]
[reporter in English] <i>With the season</i>
<i>already in crisis,</i>
<i>the Haas F1 Team are facing more pressure</i>
<i>after reports that their main sponsor,</i>
<i>Rich Energy, is pulling out.</i>
[Kravitz] There were
some rumors going around
that they had made an initial payment,
but none had been coming on after that.
Is that true?
The performance of Haas in the last two,
three months has been very poor.
I would like not to answer
any more questions
because there are
commercial agreements in place.
[Storey] <i>It's clear</i>
<i>that they're going backwards,</i>
so I formally canceled the agreement.
[Steiner] <i>I'm getting fucking sick of</i>
<i>answering these fucking stupid questions</i>
<i>on a race weekend.</i>
<i>I've never seen any fucking thing</i>
<i>like this, you know.</i>
-[reporter] Did that come as a surprise?
-Yes.
That's the last I'm saying.
Yes, it was a surprise.
[man] No more questions on that topic.
Move on.
The Rich Energy deal
was supposed to be worth $60 million.
[Steiner] This is enough.
This is not worth the hassle.
Other than the initial payment,
that was the only money we ever received,
so we're done with Rich Energy now.
[Steiner] <i>This year</i>
<i>is a roller coaster.</i>
<i>To salvage the season,</i>
<i>we need to make</i>
<i>a more radical approach</i>
<i>and try to do something very unusual.</i>
We are at the stage now,
we are just in front of Williams,
but we are hanging on in there.
But if in two races, they are ahead of us,
we cannot be slower than this.
Top speed, we are nowhere.
We are much slower than last year.
The car is completely all over the place.
It felt that bad. It was horrendous.
We do need to take some drastic action.
At the moment, we cannot find a solution.
We need to get practical.
And I think in Melbourne,
we had a decent car,
and I think one car has to change over,
go back to Melbourne spec.
At least we have something to compare now,
and if it is worse,
at least we found out
it isn't what we are looking for.
[Buxton] <i>The team is using the race</i>
<i>as a testing session,</i>
to go out, to try the old car
and the new car,
see which bits work, see which bits don't.
This is absolutely the end of the road
in terms of ideas.
[Steiner] <i>It is very unusual</i>
<i>to go back to an old spec car,</i>
<i>because you always think</i>
<i>the new one is better.</i>
<i>That's what I want to find out.</i>
[Steiner] We are not gonna vote on this,
just to be clear.
I'm not gonna tomorrow enter discussion,
"We should." "We shouldn't."
"Yes," "No," "Maybe,"
"I like it," "I don't."
I don't know who sacrifices himself,
who runs on the old car,
who runs on the new car.
I wouldn't mind
being the one to go back.
Yeah. I don't know who's going to go back.
Both are pretty happy to do it.
Because everybody's like,
"I can't believe this."
Hey, keep your head up.
[Steiner] I don't care who does it.
[Komatsu] I think we need
to do it with Romain
because he's been vocal about this
since day one.
-Okay, we do it with him.
-Yeah.
I'll speak with Kevin if needed.
But if somebody opposes to that one,
I'll sack them.
I'll take the responsibility.
[Steiner] <i>I think Melbourne's spec car</i>
<i>may be better.</i>
<i>Romain test that one.</i>
<i>Sometimes, you need to make a decision.</i>
<i>I don't think Kevin is that keen on it.</i>
<i>But you cannot have</i>
<i>always everybody content.</i>
<i>Somebody will be unhappy.</i>
<i>Deal with it.</i>
<i>We do it for the team, not an individual.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>As a driver, we wanna win.</i>
<i>But if you're not in the right car,</i>
<i>you're constantly trying</i>
<i>to achieve something</i>
<i>that actually isn't possible.</i>
[Grosjean] <i>I wanted to revert</i>
<i>back to the old spec.</i>
For me, it was more a question of,
"How can I get better results?"
[Magnussen] <i>Me and Romain,</i>
<i>we had some run-ins.</i>
<i>I don't really feel like</i>
<i>I'm an angry person,</i>
but you know, I'm aggressive.
[engineer] <i>Radio check, Romain.</i>
[Grosjean] <i>This is good.</i>
[Gannon] <i>Toby, we can go.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[Gannon] <i>Radio check, Kevin.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>Radio is good.</i>
[Magnussen] <i>The only way I can</i>
<i>motivate myself is to find this fire</i>
and just go all out.
[Grosjean] <i>Obviously, you want to try</i>
<i>to beat as many drivers as you can.</i>
Including your teammate.
[engine whirring]
[engine continues whirring]
[beeping]
[commentator] <i>The British Grand Prix</i>
<i>is underway.</i>
<i>Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>coming into the first corner.</i>
<i>Ooh! So close to his teammate there.</i>
<i>Into the hairpin right-hander.</i>
<i>Both Haases lock up!</i>
<i>Grosjean on the inside</i>
<i>and they're wheel-to-wheel again.</i>
<i>Oh! There's contact!</i>
-[man 1] What happened?
-[man 2] I don't know.
They ran into each other.
They hit each other.
[man 3] Fucking idiots!
[Grosjean] Fuck, I have a puncture.
Fuck!
[Magnussen] Ugh!
Fucking hell.
Have you got puncture as well?
Okay, both cars got punctured, okay.
That's not good at all.
[commentator] <i>Both cars are in trouble.</i>
<i>They're both gonna have to pit.</i>
<i>Grosjean and Magnussen right at the back.</i>
Stand by for double stop.
[mechanics shouting indistinctly]
[Gannon] <i>Okay, Kevin, box now, box.</i>
<i>Try and make this to the end, okay?</i>
Just bring it back.
[Magnussen] Something's loose
around my pedals.
Bring it in.
[Gannon] Okay,
we don't wanna take any risks,
so box now, for retirement.
[Croft] <i>Race over for Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>after contact with his teammate.</i>
[engineer] <i>Romain, we saw</i>
<i>quite significant floor damage</i>
<i>on the right-hand side.</i>
Just call him in. End this fucking pain.
[engineer] <i>Box, Romain, box.</i>
<i>We will retire the car.</i>
What happened?
I'm so pissed off.
Fuck, there's a lot I can accept,
but not this.
[Steiner] Ayao.
[Magnussen] <i>I got pushed out</i>
<i>by my teammate.</i>
<i>Was it on purpose or not? I don't know.</i>
<i>But as long as he's in front of me,</i>
<i>he's happy.</i>
<i>He doesn't give a shit</i>
<i>about anything else.</i>
<i>I need to calm down</i>
<i>or I'm gonna do something stupid.</i>
-[Steiner] <i>Can you go and get them?</i>
-[Komatsu] <i>Yes.</i>
-[Steiner] <i>Please?</i>
-[Komatsu] <i>Sure.</i>
[Steiner] <i>Because then</i>
<i>I can fucking go home.</i>
[Komatsu] <i>Yeah.</i>
Romain, Guenther wants to speak upstairs.
Let's go inside.
[knocking on door]
[door closes]
[Steiner] <i>I've had enough of both of you.</i>
<i>You let the fucking team down, me down,</i>
<i>which I protected you all the time.</i>
<i>And I'm not fucking going into</i>
<i>who is right and who is wrong.</i>
<i>I don't want to hear,</i>
<i>"He moved. He shouldn't have moved,"</i>
<i>and all that fucking wank, you know.</i>
<i>Gene spends hundred fucking million a year</i>
<i>of his own money</i>
<i>which wants to pull the plug</i>
<i>and let everybody down</i>
<i>because you are two idiots.</i>
<i>I've not more to fucking say to you guys</i>
<i>and if you don't like it,</i>
<i>I don't need you here.</i>
<i>Do not come back, please.</i>
[door opens]
[door bangs shut]
[Steiner] What was that?
[Komatsu] Kevin just fucking smashed
the door. That's not acceptable.
[Steiner] <i>Fucking hell.</i>
He's not fucking doing that to me,
you know?
He does not fucking smash my door.
Tell him that.
If he doesn't want to come back,
he'd better tell me now.
-[Carlsen] Has he just done that now?
-[Steiner] Yeah.
-He smashed my fucking office door.
-[Carlsen] Where is he?
[Steiner] I don't know where he is,
but he can fuck off.
I told him, both of them.
Fucking hell.
We have got two fucking idiots
driving for us.
This is not acceptable.
We will make changes.
If it would be my decision now,
I would sack them both.
[Croft] <i>Lewis Hamilton now has</i>
<i>six British Grand Prix wins to his name,</i>
<i>more than any other driver.</i>
[crowd cheering]
The Haas F1 Team means a lot to me.
<i>I think if it is a failure,</i>
<i>I would have no idea what to do next.</i>
[crowd cheering and fanfare]
Whoo!
I think we have a good team.
Everybody shows up, but then,
when we can't get the cars to perform,
the question is, "What the heck happened?
What's going on here?
What are we doing this for?"
We're here to race competitors, you know,
drivers and race strategies
and we don't do any of that.
<i>So, where do we go in the future?</i>
<i>It's a very expensive sport.</i>
<i>If we're doomed to run in the back,</i>
I don't think
I'm gonna be part of that.
[exhales]
I've seen him with that expression before.
I'll say it in French as well.
Oh, go fuck yourself.
Where's the fucking boot?
[Sainz] <i>Daniel thinks he's the best.</i>
<i>But I'm working more than anyone else</i>
<i>in Formula 1.</i>
Carlos is just quick, mate.
You should have thrown some banana peels
at my rivals.
[Ricciardo groans]
-Can you win this weekend?
-Yeah!
-[commentator 1]<i> Look at that.</i>
-[commentator 2] <i>What's happened there?</i>
[Hamilton] No, I am so fuckin' sorry.
Tough day at the office?
<i>No, it was a fucking shit day</i>
<i>at the office.</i>I would love for them to play that.
They're not gonna play that.
[Michael] <i>All right, let me get a coffee.</i>
-[Daniel] I'm gonna do a bit of a squat.
-What do you want, an espresso?
[Daniel] Yeah.
[Daniel] <i>Last year, I took a gamble</i>
<i>and switched teams.</i>
<i>Everyone was like,</i>
<i>"Why are you leaving Red Bull?"</i>
<i>A lot of people asking questions.</i>
-[Michael] You know that expression--
-Go fuck yourself. That one?
[Daniel] <i>Obviously,</i>
<i>I spoke to a few teams.</i>
<i>There was definitely talks with McLaren.</i>
[driver] Fucking stupid.
Unbelievable.
[Daniel] <i>But I guess the truth is</i>
<i>I hadn't seen enough to convince me</i>
<i>that it was gonna get better.</i>
[Daniel] <i>With Renault, I saw the momentum</i>
<i>they've had since 2016.</i>
<i>And they've had a really strong 2018.</i>
<i>That was a big attraction for me.</i>
<i>I looked at their plan</i>
<i>and when I kind of had everything</i>
<i>on the table in front of me,</i>
<i>the Renault one encouraged me</i>
<i>and convinced me more.</i>
<i>I took a chance.</i>
<i>But also, they made a big gamble</i>
<i>signing me.</i>
[engine revving]
[indistinct chatter]
[woman in Spanish]
Carlos, would you like some ham?
Do we all want gazpacho?
Yeah.
-Would anyone like wine?
-[man] I want some.
[Carlos in English] <i>I've been coming</i>
<i>to Mallorca since I'm zero years old.</i>
[woman] How awesome.
<i>It's very Spanish way</i>
<i>just to spend summer break</i>
<i>with your cousins, with your uncles,</i>
<i>grandparents, your sisters, your family.</i>
[laughing]
<i>Here, everyone is totally relaxed.</i>
[man in Spanish] It's very good, folks.
-How do you like it, Auntie Carmen?
-Very good.
It's definitely very good.
[Carlos in English] <i>Every professional</i>
<i>athlete needs their own time,</i>
<i>where you can actually relax a bit</i>
<i>and disconnect from the outside world,</i>
<i>and work, basically.</i>
But 2018 summer was a bit different.
[man in Spanish] Come on!
2018 was a bit of a weird season
for Carlos 'cause he...
<i>drove for Renault.</i>
By June, July, all the silly season
starts with a driver's market.
[announcer] <i>And the knock-on effects</i>
<i>of Ricciardo moving to Renault</i>
<i>mean Carlos Sainz will lose his seat.</i>
-[man 1] See ya.
-[woman] Bye.
[man 2] Bye.
[Caco] <i>We got a call from Cyril saying,</i>
<i>"Look, we just signed Ricciardo.</i>
That leaves you out of the team."
[in Spanish] Where do we find more fish?
In or out of the platform?
I think the inside area.
[in English] I was hurt that the Renault
car that I had been driving that year,
it was so easily taken by someone else.
[Caco] <i>We didn't really know</i>
<i>what was gonna happen in the future.</i>
[Caco in Spanish] I'm ready.
[Carlos in English] <i>My main scare</i>
<i>was not staying in Renault,</i>
it was staying in Formula 1.
<i>For me, it was 100% like,</i>
"I need to have a seat.
I will have a seat."
[Caco] <i>It was quite intense</i>
<i>'cause we were always on the phone,</i>
always on the email,
speaking to all the teams.
[Carlos in Spanish] I'm not going to fail.
[Caco in English] <i>But then, suddenly,</i>
<i>things started to fall in place.</i>
Why not take the challenge and go for it?
[Caco in Spanish] Well done.
[Carlos] Great. Now we have one.
[announcer in English] <i>Three, two, one.</i>
[announcer] <i>Big thanks</i>
<i>to the new driver line-up for McLaren.</i>
[all clapping]
[Carlos] It's a great honor to be here.
It's something special,
so I really want to thank everyone.
[Zak] <i>We got to know</i>
<i>Carlos moved very quick</i>
and very happy to have him
as a McLaren Grand Prix driver.
[Zak] Everyone in here
works unbelievably hard.
Everyone has contributed to this race car.
Collectively, us, as a group,
we're gonna all get back to where
I know we should be, can be,
and have been.
And I hope to do it soon.
[Zak] <i>2018, I don't think</i>
<i>we designed a very good race car.</i>
[man] <i>We are out of the points.</i>
[Zak] <i>So, by the end of the year,</i>
<i>we were about</i>
<i>the eighth, ninth quickest team.</i>
[man] Fucking stupid.
[announcer] <i>Not another problem</i>
<i>for McLaren!</i>
[Zak] <i>We wouldn't have put Carlos</i>
<i>in our race car</i>
<i>if we didn't think he was extremely fast.</i>
So, even though he was only 24 years old,
he's done a lot of Grand Prix,
<i>and so he's got a great blend</i>
<i>of youth and aggression,</i>
<i>but yet, you know, mature.</i>
That's what we really need
to get back to winning races.
[Zak] Hey, guys.
Where are we going?
Down or are we walkin' around?
-[woman] Straight down.
-[Zak] Straight around?
[woman] Yeah.
What did you guys do
in the Renault launch last year?
[Carlos] It was nothing special.
Nothing too...
[mutters] Not what you expect?
To be honest, no.
-Not as much...
-No.
...fanfare?
Definitely not.
-Looks good.
-It looks really good.
[Zak] Get me one of those. I'll take two!
[Carlos] Yeah.
It's year by year?
Yeah, by year, yeah.
[Carlos] <i>It's unbelievable.</i>
<i>The first time I went there,</i>
<i>the first thing that came to mind was</i>
<i>how these guys cannot be winning.</i>
McLaren last year, they had probably
one of their worst seasons in Formula 1,
if not the worst.
Hey, guys.
Shall I practice my entrance
like yesterday?
[man] The Ronaldo one?
[woman] Do the run and jump.
There's the car.
[laughing]
[Zak] <i>Our goals for 2019 have to be</i>
<i>to take a step forward.</i>
We had to make a lot of changes,
which we did.
<i>You know, now we've got two great drivers</i>
<i>in Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris.</i>
<i>And he gets along with Lando very well.</i>
They're very competitive with each other,
but in a healthy way.
High-five everyone, please.
-Please high-five everyone.
-[Lando] Imagine if I get left hanging.
-Mic check.
-That would be a good start
to our season together.
[Lando] I'm not ready.
My heart has started beating.
[woman] Shall we do a picture?
It's a big risk for Carlos,
moving to McLaren...
and not just because
of McLaren's recent troubles.
<i>If he can rebuild that team,</i>
<i>I think it would do his reputation good.</i>
<i>But if it doesn't work out for him,</i>
he could get buried
by the entire experience.
[man] Ready in 30 seconds.
[Carlos] <i>You always have doubts.</i>
<i>You wonder, "Well, what if McLaren</i>
<i>are still 17th, 16th fastest?</i>
What's gonna happen with me?"
People are gonna start
forgetting about me.
[man] Ten, nine, eight,
seven...
[Carlos] <i>But for me,</i>
<i>a new year is a new start.</i>
Then really try to forget
about the doubts.
[all clapping]
[commentator] <i>On the shores</i>
<i>of the Caspian Sea</i>
<i>are the streets of Baku,</i>
<i>the capital of Azerbaijan</i>
<i>and round four of the Formula 1</i>
<i>World Championship of 2019.</i>
[Carlos] I'm trying to smile.
Show positivity.
-[woman] Radiate positivity.
-Radiate positivity.
[Zak] <i>Well, I think, you know,</i>
<i>Carlos's first couple of races,</i>
<i>he's had... bad luck.</i>
The results have been a mixed bag.
Tonight, we'll be celebrating, 100%.
Hey, guys.
[Lando] Nothing happened.
If you get a podium, will you jump in?
[Carlos] If I get a podium,
I don't know what I'd do.
<i>Actually, it's time to turn things around,</i>
even if it hasn't been my fault,
just make it happen, you know,
just whatever I need to do, just do it.
[Daniel] All right.
Which way is it?
[crowd exclaiming] Daniel! Whoo!
[woman] I love you!
[Daniel] <i>I love coming here.</i>
[woman] Thank you!
[Daniel] <i>Baku is a high-speed</i>
<i>street circuit.</i>
[announcer] <i>Danny Ricciardo!</i>
This track creates just amazing racing.
It's so intense.
<i>But, really, with Renault,</i>
<i>so far in the season,</i>
<i>we haven't achieved what we wanted to.</i>
This season has been probably
the most challenging...
<i>experience in my career so far.</i>
[commentator] <i>And Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>losing his front wing going into turn one.</i>
[Daniel] Everything just cut out.
[Cyril] Every single race weekend,
something happened to us
<i>which had a negative impact</i>
<i>on the results.</i>
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo's Renault</i>
<i>career hasn't started that well, has it?</i>
-Pidges?
-Do your pidges and your thoracics.
First couple of races this season
were, you know...
not the way I wanted to start,
you know, my account with Renault.
[Michael] Get some speed.
Get into appropriate intensity.
Nice, mate.
[Will] <i>Moving teams is always tricky,</i>
particularly when they've spent
so much of their career in one place.
<i>I think Daniel knew that moving to Renault</i>
<i>would prove to be a challenge.</i>
<i>But I don't think he anticipated</i>
these early races
would be as hard as they've been.
[commentator] <i>It's time for Qualifying.</i>
<i>An hour of flat-out driving</i>
<i>on the streets of Baku.</i>
[Simon] Okay, at the moment,
you're clear from traffic behind.
[Daniel] Okay.
[commentator] <i>This is it.</i>
<i>He's got one lap to shine.</i>
[Daniel] How're we looking?
[Simon] You're currently P11,
five hundredths from Norris.
[Daniel] <i>I'm still not there yet</i>
<i>with this car.</i>
<i>Everything is different to the Red Bull.</i>
<i>The brakes, the throttle,</i>
<i>the feeling on the pedal.</i>
<i>It's everything.</i>
<i>All that being said,</i>
<i>it's still a race car.</i>
<i>You can drive it,</i>
<i>still nearly with your eyes closed.</i>
<i>But to drive it on the limit</i>
<i>and to really gel with</i>
<i>and understand the car,</i>
<i>that then takes a bit more time.</i>
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo crosses the line.</i>
<i>And it says 12th fastest.</i>
<i>Slowest of the 12 drivers</i>
<i>that we have had so far.</i>
[Simon] You're P12.
[Daniel] <i>Sorry, I lost the rear</i>
<i>quite early in the lap.</i>
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo doesn't seem as</i>
<i>confident on the brakes of a Renault yet</i>
<i>as he did in a Red Bull.</i>
[Will] <i>Daniel Ricciardo's</i>
<i>one of the best drivers in Formula 1</i>
and a proven race-winner.
<i>But that's not a silver bullet</i>
for a car that in and of itself doesn't
have the capability of winning races.
I still know
I can get a lot more out of it.
There's still some areas I can improve on.
For sure.
[commentator] <i>Here's Carlos Sainz,</i>
<i>still yet to score a point for McLaren</i>
<i>so far this season</i>
<i>and looking a bit on the back foot</i>
<i>coming into this qualifying session.</i>
[Carlos] <i>I think it's one of those</i>
<i>situations in this sport</i>
where you're comfortable,
you're feeling great at the wheel,
<i>but there's just one final thing,</i>
<i>which is a result.</i>
[Tom] Okay, Carlos, you are currently P12.
It's not a good lap.
[Zak] <i>Even though we knew</i>
<i>Carlos was very quick,</i>
anytime a new driver gets into your car,
they need to prove themselves.
[Tom] Okay, mate, we finished P11.
For fuck's sake.
Fuck.
So frustrating.
It's so fucking frustrating.
[Will] <i>You know, some drivers move</i>
<i>to teams and they excel,</i>
<i>and then you see them</i>
<i>sometimes move to teams</i>
and then fall short of expectations.
[Carlos in Spanish] Bad luck, man. Shit.
-[man in English]<i> Thank you.</i>
-[Daniel]<i> Thanks. No worries.</i>
Ricciardo, I thought that was not...
I think that qualifying session
was not good.
Yeah, you should've thrown
some banana peels at my rivals.
Yeah!
Totally.
[Daniel] <i>It's nearly a year</i>
<i>since I had a podium.</i>
<i>And it feels like it's been a while.</i>
<i>I felt like my best</i>
<i>was good enough for 12th place.</i>
<i>It's obviously not where we wanna be,</i>
<i>but Baku is crazy.</i>
<i>Anything can happen.</i>
<i>I've had massive highs and lows here.</i>
<i>2018 was one of the big kind of</i>
<i>controversial moments of that season.</i>
[all clapping]
<i>2017, I won the race.</i>
<i>So, I've certainly had</i>
<i>all sorts of emotions here.</i>
<i>Hopefully my experience pays off tomorrow.</i>
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>he is the lead Renault now</i>
<i>and having a better day of it.</i>
Yes.
[man] Nice job.
[Simon] P10.
[exclaims]
[commentator] <i>Now here comes one McLaren</i>
<i>on another, Carlos Sainz on Lando Norris.</i>
<i>Sainz is now the lead McLaren.</i>
[commentator] <i>Pace is looking very strong.</i>
<i>Get Magnussen out.</i>
[Daniel] Nice one, mate.
[Simon] Okay,
next car on the road is Kvyat.
3,5 ahead.
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>has got himself up to eighth.</i>
[Simon] <i>Four tenths</i>
<i>quicker than Kvyat ahead.</i>
[Simon] You gained nine tenths on Kvyat
that last lap.
You have overtake available.
And you get DRS on Kvyat now.
[Daniel] Understood.
[commentator] <i>Here comes Ricciardo,</i>
<i>king of the late brakers.</i>
<i>Can he do it to Kvyat?</i>
<i>No! He's off!</i>
[Simon] No.
[commentator] <i>This is costing him</i>
<i>a lot of time.</i>
[commentator] <i>And he's-- Oh!</i>
<i>He's just reversed into Kvyat.</i>
<i>Things go from bad to worse</i>
<i>for the unlucky Renault team.</i>
[Daniel] I didn't see him.
[engine revving]
Something feels loose.
I'm gonna box.
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo's gonna</i>
<i>have to retire, I think, from this race.</i>
[Simon] Switching off.
Switching off, please.
[Daniel] Sorry, guys.
[engine revving]
[Tom] <i>Okay, Carlos,</i>
<i>that's Grosjean in front.</i>
<i>So, Carlos, this is good so far.</i>
<i>This is good.</i>
<i>You're P7, there's two laps to go.</i>
<i>And this will be the last lap.</i>
<i>That's the chequered flag. Well done. P7.</i>
[Eric] <i>Come on, boys! Yes!</i>
Finally off the mark.
[in Spanish] Good.
-About time.
-About fucking time.
[Caco in Spanish] Long time.
First points of the year for him.
<i>Seventh was a good result.</i>
Yeah, the feeling was a bit of relief.
[Caco in Spanish] Solid, man, very solid.
[woman in English] Yeah.
It always felt like a long time coming.
[laughs]
[Zak] That was good, better.
Needed that.
Good work, guys.
-[in Spanish] How are you?
-[in Spanish] Good.
[Carlos] <i>Baku was exactly what I needed.</i>
A bit of a good result, you know,
to get my system going.
[man] Smile.
[all laugh]
[Carlos] <i>And a bit of a relief that...</i>
"Bad luck" you call it?
I call it "things not going towards me"
ended there.
Unlucky, mate.
[Daniel] <i>Obviously, I feel embarrassed</i>
<i>and I feel like an idiot.</i>
<i>I felt like</i>
<i>I had a bit of a responsibility</i>
<i>to give everyone a smile Sunday night.</i>
<i>And it just turned into shit, basically.</i>
<i>I'm feeling like the smallest guy</i>
<i>in the whole of F1, so, yeah.</i>
To be honest, as soon as I went off,
I just was like, "Reverse!"
Do a circle, no?
No, I didn't see him.
I didn't think...
[Cyril] <i>I think he gave himself just</i>
<i>one lap to overtake him</i>
<i>and made a bit of a brave maneuver,</i>
<i>which didn't work.</i>
So, frankly, it was
another embarrassing moment for Daniel,
but for the whole team.
[Daniel] <i>This sport definitely still has</i>
<i>the ability to rip your heart out</i>
<i>from one day to the next.</i>
<i>And this year, it has for me.</i>
<i>Living with your mistakes,</i>
<i>that's a tough one.</i>
<i>That's why you've sometimes</i>
<i>got to look at it</i>
<i>from a different perspective.</i>
<i>That's why I choose to come here,</i>
<i>spend some time staring at palm trees</i>
<i>and blue skies to reset my focus.</i>
It's like 33 degrees today,
so get some sun, play a bit of basketball.
The basketball's in here, right?
How's your game gonna be today?
I don't know, mate.
This would start me off strong.
-[both laughing]
-Shit!
He's on today.
[laughs]
[Daniel] <i>With Michael,</i>
<i>we have a good relationship.</i>
Kobe.
<i>Trainer, performance coach,</i>
<i>whatever the title is.</i>
-Sink that long one.
-[both exclaim]
I'll go a bit closer.
Try to get my confidence up.
[Daniel] That's it.
<i>It's definitely</i>
<i>not just physical training, you know?</i>
<i>And you need a friend</i>
<i>because we travel so much together.</i>
<i>Someone you can really open up to,</i>
<i>someone who's happy to hear my shit</i>
<i>after a long week.</i>
[Daniel] Feed me.
[Michael] <i>We met, I think,</i>
<i>when we were around 11 years old.</i>
And we've been friends ever since.
[Michael] Let's go do a bit of a stretch.
See if you can touch.
Just forget the camel toe here.
[Michael] <i>Daniel is obviously a joker.</i>
-You're way off. You're touching nothing.
-I can feel something on my bum.
[Michael] Yeah, it's not the ground.
<i>But there also is Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>the racer.</i>
He is definitely a serious competitor.
Loosen up those hips.
<i>It's extremely important</i>
<i>to be in the right head space</i>
<i>when you jump in that car,</i>
<i>so the psychological factor's huge.</i>
It makes a big difference
come race day, for sure.
[Daniel] <i>The whole Red Bull thing,</i>
<i>I discussed the move with Michael.</i>
<i>The choice, looking at McLaren,</i>
<i>and I'm not bitter towards,</i>
<i>you know, McLaren for doing well</i>
<i>because it was my decision.</i>
McLaren look quick, mate.
Carlos is just...
He's been good.
Cheers, cunt.
I feel like we've been quite unlucky,
but it is what it is.
Yeah.
Yes, I'm angry at myself,
'cause I'm always like, "I can do better."
Mate, there's no point dwelling on it.
I think your attitude's been good, mate.
You've just been fierce,
you've been competitive.
Take it as it is
and just keep working, keep building.
Try to build some more points
in Barcelona.
Yeah, exactly.
I know it's not gonna last.
[Michael] Yeah.
-[Rupert] There he is.
-[Carlos] Good morning.
[Rupert] All right, mate?
How are you? All good?
-[Carlos] Good. You?
-Yeah, good.
Is the bell still not working
or are you just ignoring me?
[Carlos] It's going to rain, yeah?
It could rain.
It's pretty much been doing that nonstop
the last few days.
-When is Sam coming?
-Welcome to the UK.
Thank you.
[Carlos] <i>Moving to the UK was...</i>
<i>it was a bit of challenging myself.</i>
It is probably the toughest of the things
to leave family, friends,
girlfriend behind.
[Carlos] We go for chicken fajitas?
It's cold.
<i>I knew McLaren</i>
<i>was gonna need me in the UK.</i>
We had a lot of work to do.
Who is doing the guacamole?
[Rupert] I'm doing the guacamole, mate.
[Carlos] You know for guacamole,
you need lime.
Ready?
Where's the fajita mix? It's not here.
I'm gonna be depressed.
It has to be here.
Excuse me, do you have
special fajita sauce, El Paso style?
He's really keen on.
-[Rupert] Here we go, mate.
-You have it?
I'm sorry to break this to you.
They might only have their own brand.
No. Then we need to go somewhere else.
Thank you very much. Nice to meet you.
[woman] And you.
[Rupert] It's not hard
to find the car, is it?
[Carlos] No.
[Rupert] Where does the shopping go?
Where is the fucking boot?
You must have a smaller bag, no?
You carry it. Come on.
[Rupert] It's my job, right?
[Carlos] Morning.
-[man] All right, mate?
-Yeah, good, you?
[Carlos] How many people
are attending the performance review?
<i>Many drivers have asked me,</i>
"Why do you spend so much time in McLaren?
Are you forced to go there?"
The way I apply the brake pressure.
[man] Yes.
A little smooth application
instead of being a bit more punchy.
[Carlos] <i>People underestimate</i>
<i>the relationship with the engineers,</i>
how important it is.
Yeah, we're going just now.
Thank you, mate.
[all chuckling]
It will show itself on track
and then it will pay off.
[Carlos] <i>Hola.</i>
-All right, mate?
-All good?
-Good.
-How's it going? All right?
[Rupert] Does that feel too tight?
Monday to Fridays in the UK,
I'm sleeping well, eating well,
<i>training, dieting</i>
<i>and I need to focus a lot in that.</i>
[Rupert] And again.
<i>As a coach, you're trying to</i>
<i>take them out of their comfort zone</i>
<i>to basically ensure</i>
<i>that when they need to get in the car,</i>
<i>that they can perform at their best.</i>
Carlos is always really looking
at ways that he can improve himself.
[Carlos] <i>That will give me the confidence</i>
<i>to go to a Formula 1 track.</i>
[Rupert] Slow it back down.
<i>Knowing that I'm working</i>
<i>more than anyone else in Formula 1.</i>
[commentator] <i>In the battle</i>
<i>for king of the midfield,</i>
<i>McLaren now have a surprise lead</i>
<i>over troubled Renault.</i>
-[Michael] Get in the zone, mate.
-[Daniel] Yep.
[Michael] You ready
for a bit of a dogfight?
[Daniel] Good man, fuckin'...
[Michael] Good, man, fucking right.
So am I.
All right, let's do it.
[Daniel] <i>As far as, you know,</i>
<i>our midfield battle goes,</i>
<i>Carlos has been a bit luckier at times.</i>
<i>So, that creates</i>
<i>a bit more tension in the rivalry.</i>
<i>I put a lot into this</i>
and I don't travel around the world
and work this hard
to, you know, not see the chequered flag.
[Daniel] <i>This is my moment to really</i>
<i>go out, when those lights go out,</i>
<i>and be as good as I can be.</i>
<i>Let's race hard.</i>
<i>May the best man win.</i>
[Carlos] <i>My period in Renault</i>
<i>is totally closed</i>
<i>and I don't see that yellow car as my car</i>
<i>and someone else driving it.</i>
<i>I want to prove to McLaren and Renault</i>
that, of the midfield,
I am the strongest driver.
<i>I don't think anyone is better than me,</i>
<i>but Daniel thinks he's the best.</i>
<i>We all think we are the best.</i>
<i>Out of all these battles</i>
<i>that are happening here,</i>
I want to be on top.
[Tom] Okay, Carlos, radio check.
[Carlos] <i>Yeah, radio's good.</i>
[Tom] <i>Copy, that's loud and clear.</i>
[Simon] <i>Radio check. Radio check.</i>
[Daniel] Let's fucking have it, boys.
[Cyril] Let's go for it, Daniel.
[announcer] <i>Ten seconds.</i>
-[crowd murmuring]
-[engines revving]
[commentator] <i>We're racing in Barcelona.</i>
<i>Daniel Ricciardo off to a good start.</i>
<i>Sainz keeping out of trouble</i>
<i>into turn one.</i>
[Tom] <i>Good, Carlos. Good job.</i>
<i>Pace is okay. Pace is okay.</i>
<i>Ricciardo looks quick.</i>
<i>Keep him behind if you can.</i>
[Simon] <i>Carlos is struggling on pace</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>
[Daniel]<i> Okay, they've</i>
<i>definitely got more speed.</i>
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo trying to</i>
<i>get past Carlos Sainz.</i>
<i>Sainz moves to the inside</i>
<i>to cover off Ricciardo.</i>
<i>He knew an attack was coming there.</i>
[Tom] <i>Good, Carlos, good job defending.</i>
<i>Try and keep him behinid.</i>
[Carlos] <i>I'm trying. I'm trying.</i>
[Simon] <i>Gained nine tenths on Carlos</i>
<i>in that last lap.</i>
<i>So, overtake is available.</i>
[Daniel] <i>Understood.</i>
[commentator] <i>Ricciardo is squeezing</i>
<i>everything out of the Renault now</i>
<i>to try and get past Carlos Sainz.</i>
<i>That's Ricciardo through!</i>
[Carlos] <i>Fuck me.</i>
[commentator] <i>Renault have</i>
<i>overtaken McLaren.</i>
[Simon] <i>Nice one, mate.</i>
<i>You're doing a good job, mate.</i>
[Daniel] Okay. I'll box this lap.
[Simon] <i>Okay, understood. Boxing.</i>
[Tom] <i>Box now. Box now.</i>
[Daniel] Ugh.
[Carlos] We did it one behind each other.
<i>And the first lap was gonna be all about</i>
<i>trying to get past Daniel again.</i>
[Simon] <i>Watch out for Sainz behind you.</i>
<i>He's also just left the box.</i>
[Daniel] <i>Understood.</i>
[Tom] Gap to Ricciardo now 1,9.
This is good, Carlos.
<i>Better than him, we're in good shape now.</i>
[man] <i>That's better.</i>
[Caco] Renault is struggling.
[Tom] <i>Right, let's go and get him, Carlos.</i>
[Simon] <i>Sainz in your DRS.</i>
[commentator] <i>And the roles are reversed.</i>
<i>Sainz back ahead of Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
[in Spanish] Come on!
Yes!
[Carlos in English] <i>Come on, boys! Yes!</i>
[Daniel] <i>He caught up to me so quickly.</i>
<i>I really couldn't do much else.</i>
[Simon] Okay, still a long way to go.
Let's stay focused.
Must get back into a rhythm.
[Tom] Good, Carlos, good job.
[Carlos] <i>That overtake move from Daniel</i>
<i>gave us the confidence.</i>
After that moment, I said,
"Maybe we can attack a bit more."
[Tom] <i>Okay, Carlos,</i>
<i>that's Grosjean in front.</i>
[commentator] <i>Sainz is in the points,</i>
<i>but hungry for more.</i>
[Carlos] <i>I had a heavy contact.</i>
<i>It was a heavy contact</i>
[Tom] <i>Copy.</i>
<i>Pressure's okay at the moment.</i>
[Caco] They were side to side.
He cannot turn in like that.
[commentator] <i>He's just got time</i>
<i>for one last go at Grosjean.</i>
[Caco] Come on!
[in Spanish] Come on!
Good!
Good!
[Carlos laughs]
[Tom in English] <i>That's a great job,</i>
<i>Carlos. Great job.</i>
[commentator] <i>Carlos Sainz</i>
<i>is up into eighth place.</i>
Well done, mate.
[man] Well done. Well done.
[Caco] Yes!
[Tom] <i>Yes, Carlos, get in.</i>
<i>Great job, mate.</i>
[Simon] <i>And that's P12.</i>
<i>Sorry, man. Tough one.</i>
[Daniel] <i>Yeah, understood.</i>
<i>It's really hard to stay close with Sainz.</i>
Sorry, guys.
[commentator] <i>Carlos Sainz,</i>
<i>another finish in the points</i>
<i>and giving his grandstand reason</i>
<i>to get on their feet.</i>
[Carlos] <i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>
That was fun.
[man] Thank you.
[Carlos] <i>I always said it.</i>
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I think it was more a matter of time.</i>
Deep in myself, I knew
what I needed to do to be quick.
[Rupert] Well done, mate.
Good job. Well done.
I have a feeling that McLaren knows
what they are doing
and I'm gonna trust it.
[in Spanish] Give me a high five.
[woman in English] Yay.
Well done, fucking amazing.
-[Zak] That was good.
-[man] Good race.
Good job, guys.
[Zak] <i>Carlos has been very impressive.</i>
I like his aggression, I like his speed.
[Carlos] Thank you, guys.
Cheers. Thank you very much.
[Zak] <i>He hasn't put a wheel wrong.</i>
And I can see him being with McLaren
for quite some time.
[Daniel] <i>I was a bit frustrated</i>
<i>with how the race panned out.</i>
<i>Yeah, I've had a few battles with Carlos,</i>
<i>but the McLarens have turned it on</i>
<i>and they've certainly been</i>
<i>our kind of midfield target this year.</i>
<i>They've got a pretty good car.</i>
<i>I need to be smart</i>
<i>and use my strengths as a driver</i>
<i>to kind of work around</i>
<i>maybe some of the weaknesses in the car.</i>
<i>I expected myself to get it quicker.</i>
[Cyril] <i>You know,</i>
<i>there is no real question mark</i>
<i>about the capacity of Daniel</i>
<i>to be a strong driver.</i>
I feel that the team is ready for Daniel.
<i>We are ready for that partnership.</i>
We just need to work harder
and give him a better car,
so that he can bring the team
to a different dimension.
[man] <i>Formula 1 racing</i>
<i>is very much like war planning.</i>
Let's crush them.
Yes!
Body's feeling sore, heart is racing.
[exclaiming] Fuck! How is this possible?
[man] It was a fucking shit day
at the office.
[Christian] Come on, Geraldine,
you'll be late to your own concert.
Hello. Who the fuck are you?
[man] <i>Pierre Gasly</i>
<i>got off to a horrible start.</i>
[Pierre] Fuck!
[man] <i>We will give Alex Albon a run.</i>
It's like an F1 car on steroids.
[upbeat music playing]I'd be surprised if Mercedes' dominance
didn't continue.
Those are the guys
who are always at the top.
[Claire Williams] <i>It's very difficult</i>
<i>for teams that don't have the budget</i>
<i>the bigger teams do.</i>
How can a team like ours
really necessarily compete?
[Christian Horner] <i>Mercedes are</i>
<i>our biggest competitor.</i>
They're the team
that are doing the winning at the moment,
so they're the team that we want to beat.
Formula 1 racing
is very much like war planning.
<i>We set our targets,</i>
<i>develop the power unit,</i>
<i>and then deploy it on the field.</i>
We are confident
about what we are able to achieve,
but we must not let one bit of complacency
creep in.
I need many fellow warriors on my journey.
We win and we lose together.
Just take it one by one.
Let's crush them.
My name is Toto Wolff
and I am the team principal
of the Mercedes Petronas
Formula 1 team.
<i>I was an entrepreneur my whole life.</i>
-Hi, mate.
-I'm having these guys all over me
-like you guys.
-[Daniel Ricciardo laughs]
[Toto Wolff] <i>In business,</i>
<i>you can always find excuses.</i>
<i>You can twist the story in your favor.</i>
-[Ricciardo] See you.
-See you.
<i>But in motor racing,</i>
<i>the absolute truth of the stopwatch</i>
<i>will tell you whether you've done</i>
<i>a good enough job or not.</i>
<i>I like the honesty about it.</i>
[beeps]
[engineer 1] <i>Can you make it</i>
<i>back to the pits?</i>
[Wolff] <i>Back in the day, this was a team</i>
<i>that was not winning races.</i>
[bleep]
[engineer 2] <i>Out of the race.</i>
<i>Stop. Stop. Stop.</i>
In the summer of 2012,
Niki Lauda was asked to join the board
and to help steer the team
into a more successful trajectory.
At the same time, Daimler approached me,
whether I was interested
in leading the team.
And this was an offer
that I couldn't turn down.
<i>Niki was one of the greatest</i>
<i>racing drivers that have existed.</i>
<i>He has become a world champion</i>
and then almost died
in a race car accident.
Half his body burned.
Overcoming his own pain, coming back,
winning a world championship
<i>made him very strong.</i>
[Niki Lauda] <i>Winning is one thing,</i>
<i>but out of losing, I always learned more.</i>
Because you don't waste time
blaming somebody else.
Analyze yourself,
change yourself to be successful.
[William Buxton] <i>Niki Lauda's role in the</i>
<i>success of Mercedes cannot be overstated</i>
because Niki had the ability
to make things happen.
Even though he'd stopped racing,
he was such a racer.
<i>Niki was a key element</i>
<i>in convincing me to join the team.</i>
If it wasn't for Niki
picking up the phone and calling him...
Lewis, I don't think,
would ever have considered moving.
<i>That's Niki. That's his power.</i>
[reporter] <i>We are here</i>
<i>for the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix.</i>
All the talk in the paddock right now
revolves around Lewis Hamilton
and his move to Mercedes.
In 2013, the tide changed
and we started to become more competitive.
<i>We were a regular challenger</i>
<i>for race wins and podiums.</i>
[crowd cheering]
Just wanna say a big thank you
to my fans.
Hey!
-You happy, right?
-Absolutely.
Having had success, been a world champion,
he understands what it's like
to have the pressure in that car.
<i>He is one of the power units</i>
<i>behind the team's success.</i>
[commentator] <i>That's five world</i>
<i>championships in a row for Mercedes.</i>
<i>An amazing achievement.</i>
[Wolff] <i>Over the years that Niki</i>
<i>and I have been in teams together,</i>
<i>what started as a joint journey</i>
<i>among colleagues</i>
<i>has developed into a friendship.</i>
[anchor 1] <i>The world of sport</i>
<i>is mourning the death of Niki Lauda.</i>
[anchor 2] <i>The three-time champion leaves</i>
<i>a legacy in his sport like no other.</i>
[anchor 3] <i>Niki will forever be</i>
<i>in our hearts and enshrined in history.</i>
[host] Good morning, Toto.
Good morning.
<i>As you can imagine, this is, uh,</i>
<i>very difficult.</i>
Um, very difficult for the team,
for all of us.
[indistinct chatter]
Uh, I keep looking at the pictures...
and, um...
find myself with tears in the eyes
every half an hour...
because he's not there anymore.
<i>That is somebody that is so dearly missed</i>
<i>in this team,</i>
<i>and dearly missed in Formula 1.</i>
<i>I feel that we have lost what was</i>
<i>the heart and soul of Formula 1.</i>
[Hamilton] <i>I miss having</i>
<i>conversations with him.</i>
<i>I got to visit Niki.</i>
<i>We spoke a lot. We were sending videos</i>
<i>to each other when he was in hospital.</i>
I was just trying to send him
positive messages,
just to keep his spirits up.
He would send me back messages
on his high and his low days.
[Hamilton] <i>We're gonna</i>
<i>lose this race, Bono.</i>
<i>I can't keep the car behind.</i>
He was with us in spirit, still is.
[commentator] <i>Hamilton wins</i>
<i>the Monaco Grand Prix.</i>
[Wolff] <i>Lewis, that was a victory worth</i>
<i>Niki. Unbelievable job, congratulations.</i>
[Hamilton] That was definitely for Niki.
<i>I really was fighting</i>
<i>with the spirit of Niki.</i>
<i>Niki's been such an influential person</i>
<i>in our team,</i>
<i>helping us get to where we are, so...</i>
I know he'll be, uh, looking down
and I know he'll take his hat off today.
So, I was just trying to stay focused
and trying to make him proud.
<i>And, uh, we're gonna try to continue that</i>
<i>through the year.</i>
[crowd cheering]
Niki's loss will have hurt Mercedes.
And with this kind of a gut punch, yeah,
the question will be asked
of how much it will affect the team
this season.
[crowd cheering]
[indistinct chatter]
[Wolff] <i>Because it's</i>
<i>the German Grand Prix,</i>
<i>we wanna do particularly well here</i>
<i>because of our home crowd.</i>
-[announcer talking indistinctly]
-[crowd cheering]
[announcer speaks German]
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[indistinct conversation]
Oh, yeah.
I'm the one-eyed
amongst the blind here, no?
[Guenther Steiner] You're the most
important one, though, so...
you can be late.
[chuckles]
So arrogant.
Be a bit more intelligent today
than normal.
-What?
-Be more intelligent today.
I'm always intelligent.
You don't get the humor.
[in German] You can speak German.
I know that you're married
to an English woman,
but you can speak German to me.
[Wolff] But you have less oxygen
up in the mountains.
[Steiner] Yes, but then, when we come
down, we are the best runners.
[host in English] <i>Welcome to the</i>
<i>Friday press conference</i>
<i>ahead of the 2019 German Grand Prix.</i>
[camera shutters clicking]
[in German] How do you put this on?
You're really stupid
if you can't manage to do that.
You've been here a thousand times.
[in English] Even the guy from
the mountains knows how to put it on.
The only one not is Toto,
so that proves a point.
[journalist] Toto, if I could start
with you, please.
You're celebrating 125 years
in motorsport.
What would it mean to win this race,
given that you also have
the title sponsorship?
We're having a dedicated livery,
we're wearing
a different team kit tomorrow
and lots of activities are on the track.
But on the other side,
it's 25 points that are as many points
as on any other given circuit
and we just need to add
another good race performance
in order to make a step
towards a championship.
-[Wolff] You okay?
-[engineer] Yeah, you?
You never know what's around the corner,
but at the moment,
everything seems all right.
That'll do for now.
That'll do for the next 20 minutes.
[Wolff] Yeah.
[Horner] <i>We won the championship</i>
<i>four years in a row.</i>
2010 to end of 2013.
<i>Then Mercedes have won it</i>
<i>every single year since then.</i>
<i>They're rivals.</i>
<i>They're the team that we want to beat.</i>
[tools whirring and drilling]
[Wolff] <i>For me,</i>
<i>there is 1,600 superstars in Mercedes.</i>
<i>But the strengths of the team,</i>
<i>it's every single individual.</i>
<i>I cannot drive the car.</i>
<i>I am not able to design</i>
<i>an aerodynamic surface.</i>
But I try to understand everything
around the guy who can.
<i>And I try to provide a framework</i>
<i>for these individuals</i>
<i>to perform at their best.</i>
[technician] What was your other question?
The other question
was in terms of the upgrade package.
[Hamilton] Even though
we're relatively fast,
the front end is really, really weak...
[Wolff] <i>I think the best Formula 1 drivers</i>
<i>have some common traits.</i>
<i>Talent, nurture...</i>
<i>and adversity...</i>
<i>and overcoming the adversity,</i>
<i>and this is the single most important</i>
<i>ingredient I have seen.</i>
[Hamilton]<i> I remember how hard</i>
<i>my parents worked.</i>
They sacrificed everything they have,
so when I get in the car, I...
<i>I don't want to squander</i>
<i>what they worked for.</i>
Right, any questions?
Drivers okay?
All right, thanks, everyone.
[Wolff] <i>We have the challenge</i>
<i>of managing two drivers within the team.</i>
Lewis is the best racing driver
of his generation
<i>with five world championship titles.</i>
<i>Valtteri is</i>
<i>an extremely talented, uh, racing driver.</i>
<i>He's performing on a very high level.</i>
[Valtteri Bottas] <i>To be in the same team</i>
<i>with Lewis,</i>
to be honest,
sometimes it's a pain in the ass,
because he's pretty quick. [chuckles]
You know, he's tough to beat.
It was a very conscious decision
to take Valtteri on board.
[Bottas] <i>There was many</i>
<i>difficult things to accept</i>
<i>in terms of in which kind of role</i>
<i>I had to be in the team,</i>
<i>in more like a supportive role.</i>
<i>But it's difficult.</i>
<i>The only thing I want to do as a driver</i>
<i>is win the race.</i>
<i>When Lewis beats me...</i>
<i>it's like turning a knife in me.</i>
People can think whatever they want.
I'm here to win.
[engines revving]
[commentator] <i>Mercedes celebrating</i>
<i>125 years in motorsport.</i>
<i>The team decided to go back to 1954,</i>
<i>their first-ever Formula 1 Grand Prix</i>
<i>and deck the team out in '50s gear.</i>
<i>It looks brilliant.</i>
[Wolff] <i>It's a long history</i>
<i>and a long tradition,</i>
<i>so we are getting dressed up.</i>
We are not celebrating a lot normally.
It's the first time that I can remember
that we are making such an effort
<i>for one single event</i>
<i>in terms of the extra activities.</i>
[in German] I get scared
when I see you. [laughs]
[Wolff] I'm a Mafia boss.
[speaks German and chuckles]
[in German] We are dressed up today
in 1950s outfits,
a tribute to 125 years of motorsport
and we're walking around like a carnival.
[presenter] There are lots
of Lewis fans here, of course.
He doesn't feel well.
Can you enlighten us?
Is it dehydration, or what is it?
Yeah, he's really not feeling well.
There is a virus
making the rounds in the paddock,
which he has caught.
[in English] <i>It's not like man flu,</i>
<i>it's real.</i>
<i>I said to him</i>
<i>that if he doesn't feel well,</i>
<i>he can easily skip the briefings</i>
<i>and go in the motorhome.</i>
[Hamilton] Burning up.
Shit, it's too hot in here.
As a racing driver, you can't ever be ill
<i>on the race weekend,</i>
<i>you always have to arrive 100%.</i>
<i>But I had a fever of 40 degrees.</i>
<i>I was just feeling weak. I was...</i>
<i>Massive sweats.</i>
<i>I was barely sleeping.</i>
[Buxton] <i>Qualifying sets the grid</i>
<i>for Sunday,</i>
so any driver being ill
is an issue for a team,
but especially
when it's your lead driver
<i>and the guy gunning</i>
<i>for a world championship.</i>
<i>Obviously, they've got Valtteri</i>
<i>and the reserve driver, Esteban Ocon,</i>
but going into your 200th Grand Prix,
your 125th anniversary,
<i>you want your lead driver there,</i>
<i>fighting fit and leading your charge.</i>
[Bono] Lewis, how you getting on?
Relatively speaking.
[Hamilton] <i>Yeah, it's...</i>
[Hamilton breathing heavily]
<i>Qualifying's a fast-paced</i>
<i>hundred-meter sprint.</i>
High-intensity, high focused,
highly charged.
<i>It's all about being calm, composed</i>
<i>and centered,</i>
<i>but I'm getting in the car,</i>
body's feeling sore,
<i>my heart is racing.</i>
[Hamilton] Just give me normal gloves.
They won't fit on.
[Wolff] Lewis, hi, this is Toto.
I've opened the channel. Tell me.
[Hamilton] It's just a long run.
Don't... don't feel great.
But, uh...
I'm okay to drive.
Good to go.
[Bono] Okay, good man.
[commentator] <i>Lewis Hamilton, he must be</i>
<i>looking over his shoulder a little bit.</i>
<i>The young guns,</i>
<i>Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc,</i>
<i>are really getting their act together.</i>
<i>So far, he's had an answer to everything.</i>
[engine revving]
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen</i>
<i>across the line.</i>
<i>He's quickest at the moment.</i>
<i>But Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>is going quicker than Verstappen</i>
<i>by 3,5 tenths of a second.</i>
[Bono] <i>Lewis, you're all clear behind.</i>
[commentator] <i>Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>begins his first lap.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>That's a horrible first</i>
<i>sector for Lewis Hamilton.</i>
<i>He took a lot of curb</i>
<i>on the way into turn one</i>
<i>and I think that threw him slightly wide.</i>
[Hamilton] I got traffic on my lap.
[Bono] <i>Copy.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Lewis Hamilton,</i>
<i>13th fastest.</i>
<i>And that is not gonna be good enough.</i>
<i>He's going to have to go</i>
<i>way faster than that.</i>
[Hamilton] How far was I off there?
[Bono] <i>I'd say, in terms of sectors,</i>
<i>to Leclerc, it's 4,5, sector one,</i>
6,5, sector two, and 4,5, sector three.
[Hamilton] <i>It's difficult to put</i>
<i>into terms just how hard it is.</i>
<i>You're chasing milliseconds.</i>
But as a kid, I always knew that
if I just work harder than everyone else,
I should be able
to achieve something extraordinary.
And that's how I've been wired.
[Hamilton] I'll see how much
I can catch up.
[commentator 2]
<i>Hamilton's going faster now.</i>
[Hamilton] Am I in trouble?
[Bono] <i>Negative.</i>
Currently P3, six tenths to Leclerc, P1.
Okay, Lewis, you're good to go.
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen</i>
<i>is the challenger to the Mercedes.</i>
[Bono] <i>Lewis, keep the pace up.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton very quick,</i>
<i>fastest of the weekend so far.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>And Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>is on provisional pole.</i>
<i>So, here come the challengers.</i>
<i>Valtteri Bottas first.</i>
<i>Crosses the line. Can't beat his teammate.</i>
<i>Hamilton,</i>
<i>will he be beaten by Max Verstappen?</i>
<i>No!</i>
[Bono] <i>Get in there, Lewis.</i>
<i>That's the one, mate.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton was half a second</i>
<i>faster than Bottas.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen splitting the two Mercedes.</i>
Lewis, this is Toto.
You never stop to amaze us.
Congratulations.
[Hamilton] Thank you, Toto.
Good job, guys.
I don't know how we did that one,
but grateful for all the hard work.
[commentator 1] <i>In their 200th Formula 1</i>
<i>Grand Prix start,</i>
<i>Mercedes will be starting</i>
<i>on pole position.</i>
[presenter] Congratulations
to the top three qualifiers
for the 2019 German Grand Prix.
Starting in third place
will be Valtteri Bottas,
in second, Max Verstappen,
and taking the 87th pole of his career
and his fourth of 2019,
our pole-sitter, Lewis Hamilton.
[journalist] Question for Max.
So, Max, you're starting second tomorrow
and do you think, tomorrow,
you can have...
[Hamilton] <i>Each year, it's a new challenge</i>
<i>from different people.</i>
[Max Verstappen] Yeah, I believe
that normally, in the race,
we are always
a little bit more competitive.
Of course,
I'm starting on different tires...
[Hamilton] <i>All these drivers</i>
<i>are incredibly talented.</i>
It's small percentages between us all.
[Verstappen] Yeah, we're working hard
on it, and I'm pretty pleased about today.
[Hamilton] <i>It's easier to chase</i>
<i>than it is to lead.</i>
All I can do is just put all my energy
into that car.
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[indistinct chatter in German]
[Wolff]<i> Formula 1 is a hostile environment</i>
<i>that will judge you every single day</i>
<i>and that gives it</i>
<i>a huge intensity and pressure.</i>
<i>And on the free evenings,</i>
<i>you want to leave the hostilities</i>
<i>of the paddock behind.</i>
<i>Most of the evenings,</i>
<i>it was Niki and myself.</i>
<i>We would always travel together.</i>
<i>I lost a friend when he died.</i>
Niki was particular, you know,
when you get in the car.
I guess we are the same.
All that needs to be
in the central position.
Twenty-two degrees.
All these little things in the middle,
then Niki was happy.
<i>Being able to have a dinner together,</i>
<i>which we had every single day</i>
<i>on the racetrack,</i>
<i>is a safe environment that I miss.</i>
<i>I think about our friendship</i>
<i>every single day.</i>
<i>I miss having an ally,</i>
<i>having a sparring partner, a spokesperson</i>
<i>in the paddock.</i>
<i>Since Niki's not around anymore,</i>
<i>it feels different.</i>
I miss him so much.
[Ted Kravitz] <i>Yes! Wet race!</i>
<i>I've been waiting all year for this.</i>
<i>This is fantastic.</i>
[crowd cheering]
They always say rain is the big equalizer
in Formula 1,
<i>because your equipment</i>
<i>doesn't matter so much anymore.</i>
It's all down to feel.
And where you can find the grip
around the track.
[Wolff] <i>When the weather changes,</i>
<i>it is what makes motor racing excited</i>
because it gives it a certain sense
of vulnerability.
It's not always the quickest car
and quickest driver wins the race.
[tools drilling]
[Horner] A bit of patience
in this weather.
[Verstappen] Yeah, and...
good communication.
[Horner] Absolutely.
Just keep us informed.
-You see more than we do on the pit wall.
-[Verstappen] Yeah.
-[Horner] Dutch weather!
-[Verstappen] Yeah.
[Horner] <i>I have a feeling that if we</i>
<i>can put a bit of pressure on Mercedes,</i>
I think that they could be exposed.
That makes the dynamic,
you know, quite interesting.
[Horner] I hope that we get
an exciting race.
I'd love to see Verstappen and Hamilton
have a good fight.
-Good race.
-That's a good one, yeah.
[Wolff] <i>This is a sport</i>
<i>that is so intense.</i>
<i>It is about delivering 21 times</i>
<i>every single year</i>
<i>against the best competitors.</i>
We are only as good as our last race.
[Hamilton] <i>The biggest challenge</i>
<i>for a racing driver</i>
<i>is punching out results</i>
<i>weekend after weekend.</i>
Not making mistakes.
[Bono] Lewis, in terms of the radar,
we think it's gonna be more of the same.
So, light rain
for the next 30 to 60 minutes.
My approach is always one race at a time
because you don't know what's ahead,
so you just focus on what's
in front of you in the present.
[engineer] <i>One minute.</i>
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>
[engines revving]
[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton gets away</i>
<i>pretty well, but Verstappen is struggling.</i>
[tires screeching]
[Hamilton] It's still slippery
as hell, man.
[commentator 1] <i>Oh, there's a spin.</i>
<i>It's Sergio Perez.</i>
[Sergio Perez] Sorry, guys.
[commentator 1] <i>Huge amount of spray.</i>
<i>This is really testing.</i>
[Bono] <i>Lewis, Valtteri is the car behind</i>
<i>and a gap to Verstappen.</i>
[commentator 2]<i> Verstappen</i>
<i>in his pursuit now of Bottas.</i>
[indistinct commotion]
[engineer] <i>Just be patient, Max.</i>
[Bono] <i>Lewis, let us know</i>
<i>if you think it's ready for dry tires.</i>
[Hamilton]<i> Because you're doing</i>
<i>200 miles an hour,</i>
it's really hard to see
if the track is dry or wet.
I'm okay for now.
These tires are knackered, though.
You go to turn six, it's raining heavily,
you go to turn two, it's dry.
[Bono] <i>And we have rain in the pit lane.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Oh! That is Carlos Sainz.</i>
It's still raining.
[commentator 1]
<i>Here's Verstappen losing it.</i>
[Verstappen] Fuck's sake!
[commentator 1]
<i>Oh! And Leclerc's gone off!</i>
[Charles Leclerc] Fuck!
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton is the</i>
<i>race leader, cruising out in front.</i>
[Bono] <i>Looks good now.</i>
<i>Valtteri six seconds behind,</i>
<i>Verstappen 7,2.</i>
[Hamilton] Box, I lost the frickin' wing.
[Bono] <i>Yeah, coming in.</i>
[Hamilton] How bad is the damage
to the car?
[Bono] <i>Uh, we need to have a look.</i>
<i>Lewis coming in. He needs a front wing.</i>
[man 1] No, it's Lewis here.
Drive through.
Seventy-six.
[Hamilton] You need to hurry up. I'm here.
[man 1] Don't put these tires on, guy.
Front wing off, please.
[man 2] Seventy-six.
[man 3] Set 16 for Lewis, set 16.
-[man 1] Lift it up.
-[man 2] Wing change.
[Hamilton] Come on, let's go.
Average pit-stop length in Formula 1
is about two seconds.
[Hamilton] Time to get out.
[man 1 talks indistinctly]
So, a minute is a year
in Formula 1 terms.
[commentator 1] <i>Finally, he pulls away</i>
<i>after a minute spent in the pit lane.</i>
[Hamilton] <i>Then I got back going</i>
<i>and your confidence</i>
<i>really takes a beating.</i>
And then it's really hard
to build it back up.
[commentator 2] <i>There is the Renault</i>
<i>of Nico Hulkenberg.</i>
<i>This is one of the craziest races.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen</i>
<i>has retaken the lead.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Stroll's second,</i>
<i>Kvyat's third.</i>
[Hamilton] What position
have I dropped back to?
[Bono] <i>Unfortunately, Lewis,</i>
<i>you dropped back to position 12.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton got some</i>
<i>catching to do.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Game on</i>
<i>in the last 16 laps.</i>
I don't think
I've ever been a great loser.
<i>Or great in defeat.</i>
It's just in my DNA.
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton pushing hard.</i>
[Bono] <i>You were purple sector</i>
<i>three last lap.</i>
<i>Okay, so push, push.</i>
[tires screeching]
[commentator 2] <i>Oh! He just keeps it out</i>
<i>of the wall there, Hamilton!</i>
If a team make a mistake,
it is kind of out of your hands,
but if you've practiced and practiced
and you've put so much focus and effort in
and then you drop the ball...
[commentator 1] <i>A rare error.</i>
...oh, it's really hard to deal with.
[Hamilton] Retire the car.
[Bono] <i>Negative, Lewis, negative.</i>
<i>There's always opportunities.</i>
[Wolff] <i>We must never give up,</i>
<i>even if the situation looks desperate,</i>
because even if
it's just about collecting a single point,
that can make a difference
to a championship.
[Bono] <i>So, Lewis is out of the points.</i>
<i>We're fighting for P2. Come on.</i>
[Buxton] <i>All of the team's hopes</i>
<i>now sit with Valtteri</i>
to bring home the result they want
on their 200th Grand Prix.
In that moment,
you know you have a great chance.
[Bono] <i>Come on, Valtteri.</i>
<i>It's critical to get through.</i>
It always makes you push even harder.
You know you have a great opportunity
to get some big points.
[crashes]
[commentator 2] <i>And that's Bottas!</i>
<i>Bottas has put it in the wall!</i>
[in German] Fuck! How is this possible?
[Bono in English] <i>Everything okay,</i>
<i>Valtteri?</i>
[Bottas] Yeah, I'm all good.
I'm sorry, guys.
In turn one, there was this one dry line.
<i>I must have gone in</i>
<i>just a tiny bit too quickly.</i>
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>we are speaking about millimeters.</i>
I just drifted onto the damp part
on the outside.
Immediately, I knew...
there wouldn't be really a way
to catch it.
<i>I knew that was it.</i>
I wasted one of the big opportunities
for the title.
<i>There's so many team members</i>
<i>that are giving their absolute everything</i>
<i>and with one single mistake of one driver,</i>
<i>you can lose it all.</i>
[Bono] <i>Valtteri's just gone off</i>
<i>at turn one.</i>
[Hamilton] How's it gone this bad?
[commentator 2] <i>It has not gone well</i>
<i>for the Mercedes team today.</i>
We lost the race
because we weren't good enough.
Our racing wasn't good enough.
[commentator 2] <i>And it's fireworks</i>
<i>and flames for Max Verstappen,</i>
<i>the winner of the German Grand Prix.</i>
[Horner] Well done, guys.
Fucking mega!
[all cheering]
That was terrible today.
[man] It was more than terrible.
[Wolff] Catastrophic.
What did you say?
I couldn't hear you.
A tough day at the office?
No, it was a total crap, fucking shit,
awful day at the office.
Not a tough day at the office.
<i>When you screw up,</i>
<i>you want to identify the person.</i>
<i>It's how the human mind works.</i>
<i>But we have a no-blame culture.</i>
<i>We blame the problem</i>
<i>rather than the person,</i>
<i>which is easier said than done.</i>
-[journalist] That was not easy, right?
-No.
[journalist] What went wrong?
[Wolff] It all went wrong.
[host] Okay.
Who would like to take the first question?
Toto, just how embarrassing
is this for you?
Home race for the team,
having Netflix here,
you know, you've got the outfits...
Everything was poised for the celebration,
but you've ended up with a car in 11th
and a car in the kitty litter.
Can't be too good.
[Wolff] You want to have a headline
for <i>The Sun</i> from me?
I'm not gonna give you a headline.
[journalist] I'll do that, don't worry.
Yeah, I know.
Um, it was a terrible day for us.
Should I actually respond to you
when you give me such an answer?
[journalist] Why not?
Um...
Lewis put the car in the wall
and then we made the wrong call
with the tires.
The tires were not ready.
But, uh, yeah, I wouldn't want to pin it
to one bad decision or one incident.
There was a multitude of things
that went wrong.
[Hamilton] I'm really sorry.
[Wolff] No, when we make mistakes,
we all make them together.
[Hamilton] I'm so fucking sorry, man.
Just rolled out that fucking corner.
Fuck.
I think coming in around the bollard
was the right reaction.
You would have lost tons of time
into the lap with a half-broken wing.
We would have made a better tire decision,
that's for sure,
but the reset reaction is coming in.
You just lost your front wing.
I wouldn't beat myself up on that one.
Yeah.
Fuck.
I'm still just baffled...
with how it went from
bad to worse today. And, um...
Yeah.
All I can say is,
just on my behalf, sorry...
for not, uh, pulling through.
[Lauda] <i>Everybody makes mistakes.</i>
<i>Vital mistakes.</i>
<i>For me, this was not a problem.</i>
[Wolff] <i>We need to remember</i>
<i>that Niki would say</i>
<i>that as a team,</i>
<i>you will always have setbacks.</i>
There's not one single team out there
that wins every race.
But the most difficult races,
the most painful events,
are the ones where you learn the most.
<i>At the end, we will learn from it.</i>
<i>We will recover and come out stronger.</i>
[Geri] Who's your favorite driver?
Whoever's winning for us.
Just make sure the car looks like that
at the end of the session, yeah?
<i>Everybody's expecting</i>
<i>to see the Red Bull cars</i>
<i>near the front of the field.</i>
[Pierre Gasly] No!
He needed to come in
and change his underwear, I would think.
We're gonna remove that subject
and put you in place.
-Can you win this weekend?
-Yeah!
You can occasionally kiss if you want.
[Wolff] <i>Everybody expects us to win.</i>
<i>But we need to fight to stay on top.</i>Ah!
We've got Rice Krispies on the dog.
It's like a chimp's tea party, isn't it?
Can I have some poached eggs, please?
When you get the chance.
What's your favorite car, Mol?
[Olivia] A digger!
[Christian chuckling] A digger? A digger!
She's coming, everyone, hide!
[shushes] Monty, get down! Get down!
[chuckles]
-Hey!
-[Christian] Hi!
[Geri] Hey! Hi, darling!
-No, I haven't seen the children.
-[children] Hey!
-[Christian chuckles]
-[Geri] Hey!
Mommy!
[Monty] Go!
[Geri] Hi.
[Christian] Right.
-Who's your favorite driver, Bluey?
-Lewis Hamilton.
[Christian] You're winding me up now,
aren't you?
You're winding me up!
Who's your favorite driver?
Sebastian.
Sebastian?
Who's your favorite driver?
-[Bluebell] Please say Max Verstappen.
-[Monty] Max.
-Oh! We got a Max fan.
-[Bluebell] Yay! [chuckles]
And Daddy.
[Christian] And Daddy.
Daddy's not the driver, though. So...
[Geri] Christian,
who's your favorite driver?
Who's my favorite driver?
[Geri] Come on, tell the truth.
[Christian] Well...
I don't know...
Uh...
Who is ever winning for us.
[Christian]<i> Last season,</i>
<i>we lost Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
Did I say his name right?
-[interviewer] Ricciardo?
-[woman] Riccardo.
-Is it Ricar... Riccardo or...
-[woman] Riccardo.
-He only drove for us for five years.
-[man laughs]
[woman] Yeah.
-So, Riccardo?
-[woman] Riccardo.
Yeah, we lost Daniel Ricciardo.
For us, that was slightly unexpected.
All right, good, that's great.
[man 1] Remove the smile.
Be a bit more intense.
[man 2] Couple more. Hold it.
Thanks, Max. Okay.
[Christian]<i> Max is</i>
<i>arguably the hottest property</i>
<i>in Formula 1 at the moment.</i>
[man 2] Little bit more
smile with your eyes.
Yep. There. Good, that's great.
So, we had to think long and hard
about who would be the right teammate
for Max Verstappen.
[man 2] Pull your helmet back
a little bit if you can.
-[Christian] <i>It's a tough gig.</i>
-Nice. That first look up.
Money. So good.
[Christian]<i> Looking within our own</i>
<i>talent pool, to step into that seat,</i>
<i>Pierre Gasly was the obvious candidate.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>That's Pierre Gasly.</i>
<i>He's come fourth for Toro Rosso.</i>
[crowd cheers]
[commentator 2] <i>That's one of the greatest</i>
<i>Grand Prix finishes.</i>
[all cheering]
[Christian]<i> Product of</i>
<i>the Red Bull Junior team,</i>
<i>he stepped up into the lead team.</i>
[Pierre]<i> Coming to Red Bull</i>
<i>was a really special moment.</i>
I tried to stay calm...
even though inside me, there was, like,
so much fire and I wanted to explode.
[man] Nice. Big smiles.
[laughs]
[Max chuckles]
Oh, here he is. [chuckles]
I didn't see you. You good, man?
No, I was like,
"Why are they laughing at me?"
[man] I'm sorry, Pierre.
We didn't mean to laugh at you.
-[Pierre] Money. Money, money...
-[man] Money in the bank!
[Pierre] Hello.
Who the fuck are you? [chuckles]
I'm Pierre Gasly. And you?
[Christian] <i>Now, Max is extremely</i>
<i>impressive for a 21-year-old.</i>
[all cheering]
[Max] Yes!
[Christian] Race winner,
what a debut. Fantastic.
<i>At the Barcelona race in 2016,</i>
<i>winning on his debut.</i>
[commentator] <i>Well done to Max Verstappen.</i>
[Christian] <i>Eighteen years of age.</i>
<i>But don't underestimate Pierre Gasly.</i>
<i>He's a great talent.</i>
What is your earliest memory
of racing each other?
[both chuckle]
[Max] You know what
I'm going to say, right?
You know what I'm gonna say.
-2010 La Conca.
-[Pierre] Yeah.
-[both laugh]
-[Pierre] You fucking bastard.
Wow. So, the story was,
I had to start every heat...
Six heats on Friday and Saturday
behind Pierre.
-[chuckles] But--
-How many-- How many times--
How many times did I push Pierre
off the track in the first corner?
But this is actually
my first memory as well,
like, really fighting...
Fighting each other.
[Christian] <i>The biggest question mark</i>
<i>we have is,</i>
<i>"Is he gonna be up to the task, delivering</i>
<i>at the kinda level of Max Verstappen?"</i>
<i>Monaco's the big event of the year.</i>
Morning.
<i>Last year was a fantastic race for us.</i>
<i>Winning the Grand Prix.</i>
<i>So there's that pressure.</i>
<i>Everybody's expecting to see the Red Bull</i>
<i>cars near the front of the field.</i>
Good morning, gents. Hi.
Good morning, Nige.
[indistinct chatter]
[Max] What do you think?
-Looks sick! [chuckles]
-[Max] Nice! [chuckles]
[Pierre]<i> Monaco is really something</i>
<i>that gives me goosebumps.</i>
There's no track in the calendar
that is that challenging for us drivers,
so, it's a mental challenge.
<i>Max is one, if not the best driver</i>
<i>on the grid at the moment.</i>
<i>So, it pushes me</i>
<i>because I know it's possible</i>
<i>to achieve these kind of performances.</i>
[indistinct chatter]
I think what is the most important
is that we get the best out of each other
and that's, at the end of the day,
the best also for the team.
[Christian]<i> Of course, both drivers get</i>
<i>exactly the same equipment.</i>
[indistinct chatter]
You are measured directly
against your teammate.
[man and Pierre speak French]
-[in English] You good?
-[man] Yeah, you?
[Christian]<i> And we need both of those cars</i>
<i>scoring as many points as we possibly can.</i>
[Christian] You all right?
Are you driving today or not?
-[Pierre] Am I driving?
-Are you driving this morning...
-[Pierre] Yeah.
-[Christian] Okay.
-So, we're just hanging out.
-[both chuckle]
Just make sure the car looks like that
at the end of session.
[Pierre] Yeah, definitely.
[Christian] <i>Pierre Gasly. His career at</i>
<i>Red Bull Racing got off to a bad start.</i>
<i>He crashed twice in pre-season testing.</i>
<i>Did close to €2 million worth of damage.</i>
<i>That knocked his confidence.</i>
<i>And Monaco is a track</i>
<i>that is all about confidence.</i>
<i>For Pierre, that just</i>
<i>makes life even harder.</i>
[Pierre] The car pull is good.
[engineer]<i> Lift your pace now.</i>
[Pierre] Okay, copy, it's good.
[engineer] <i>Excellent, Pierre.</i>
[Pierre] Oh!
-Fuck!
<i>-</i>[commentator]<i> Gasly makes a mistake.</i>
<i>A cold shiver down his back,</i>
<i>I'm sure, now.</i>
[Christian] Ouch.
[engineer 1] Did you see how close
he came to binning this one?
-Yeah.
-[engineer 2] He caught it quite well.
-He caught it nicely!
-Yeah.
[engineer 1] Yeah, fortunately.
Then needed to come in
and change his underwear, I think!
[engineer 1] I reckon he did, too.
[Pierre] Where I lose a lot is, uh...
the chicane.
-[Christian] Yes.
-[Pierre] Yeah.
At the right-hander,
you seem to come in...
-Later.
-...later. I see you taking a later apex.
Yeah. And then after, I'm also slower,
so I go on the gas--
And then you got a bigger turn...
-For the left one. Yeah.
-...for the left.
[Pierre] Yeah. For sure...
It's wrong.
I don't need anyone to tell me,
"That's what you need to do."
<i>Because the target they set me</i>
<i>is lower than the one I set to myself.</i>
<i>That's the way I work.</i>
[Christian] Right, usual street race.
-Don't be a hero.
-[Pierre] Yeah. In the first lap.
-In the first fucking lap.
-[Pierre] Yeah.
Okay?
-Just go with the track.
-[Pierre] This should be good.
[Christian] The circuit's
going to be horrible.
-Just keep building up.
-[Pierre] Yeah, I know.
All French drivers go well here.
It's almost compulsory.
-So, it'll be all right.
-[Pierre] Yeah.
[Christian] <i>Formula 1</i>
<i>is all about pressure.</i>
<i>We need Pierre to deliver</i>
<i>week in, week out.</i>
<i>The expectation is you gotta perform,</i>
<i>and I think, if he can do that here,</i>
<i>that'll just give him a lift in confidence</i>
<i>and set him up nicely for the races ahead.</i>
[man cheering]
[engineer] Thirty seconds.
[Pierre] Okay.
[engines revving]
[Christian] Take care.
[David]<i> And the Monaco Grand Prix</i>
<i>is go!</i>
<i>Bottas tries to cover up Verstappen.</i>
<i>It's wheel-to-wheel.</i>
<i>Bottas just squeezes ahead.</i>
<i>So, it's Hamilton, Bottas, and Verstappen,</i>
<i>the top three.</i>
[commentator]<i> There's Pierre Gasly.</i>
<i>Down in seventh.</i>
[Pierre] <i>Monaco, it gives you</i>
<i>so much adrenaline.</i>
<i>Being as fast as you can,</i>
<i>but without losing the concentration,</i>
<i>otherwise you're in the wall.</i>
<i>Your level of focus is just so high.</i>
<i>You switch to a different mode.</i>
<i>Unconscious.</i>
<i>You do based on your feeling,</i>
<i>you just switch to a different person.</i>
[engineer] <i>Keep doing this pace.</i>
[Pierre] Okay.
[all] Oh!
[Martin]<i> Leclerc's hit the barrier!</i>
<i>He's got a right rear puncture.</i>
<i>Pieces of Ferrari everywhere.</i>
<i>-</i>[engineer] <i>We've got safety car.</i>
<i>-</i>[Max] Safety car.
[engineer] <i>Safety car.</i>
<i>Keep your dash posted.</i>
<i>Max, box and confirm, Max.</i>
<i>Box pit confirm, mate.</i>
[Max] Yeah.
[commentator] <i>So while the track</i>
<i>is being cleared,</i>
<i>the drivers dive into the pits</i>
<i>for a change of tires.</i>
<i>Who's going to come out first?</i>
[Martin] <i>Oh!</i>
[David] <i>Verstappen looks like</i>
<i>he's ahead of Bottas.</i>
<i>He is ahead of Bottas.</i>
[commentator] <i>The Red Bull team</i>
<i>have gained a position in the pits.</i>
[David] <i>Verstappen now in second.</i>
[commentator] <i>Pierre Gasly in sixth place.</i>
<i>Four places behind his teammate.</i>
[engineer] <i>Pierre,</i>
<i>keep looking after your tires.</i>
<i>Let's get this car home.</i>
[Pierre] <i>Okay, copy.</i>
[engineer] <i>This is good, Max.</i>
<i>Keep the pressure up.</i>
-[Max] How many laps to go?
-[engineer] <i>Ten laps remaining.</i>
[David] <i>Verstappen is really taking</i>
<i>the fight to Lewis Hamilton here,</i>
<i>the championship leader.</i>
[engineer] <i>You can overtake Hamilton</i>
<i>and drive off into the distance.</i>
[Max] I'm trying to.
[engineer] <i>I'll leave that with you, mate.</i>
<i>Come up.</i>
[Lewis] Those tires
aren't feeling too good, huh?
Left front is dead.
[Bono] <i>Okay. Copy, Lewis.</i>
[engineer] <i>Come on, Max.</i>
<i>Keep the pressure up, mate.</i>
[Martin] <i>Verstappen smells a victory here.</i>
<i>-Go on, Max!</i>
<i>-Go on!</i>
[Lewis] Tire doesn't want to turn.
These tires are dead.
We need to hope for a miracle.
He's on my ass.
I think I'm in big trouble, guys.
-[engineer] <i>Okay, Max, last lap.</i>
-[Max] Yeah.
Thread the needle.
-[engineer] <i>You got this.</i>
-[Max] I'm trying.
[David] <i>Here goes Verstappen!</i>
<i>Oh! They've made contact!</i>
[all] Oh!
[Max] Shit, shit, shit.
-[engineer] <i>That's a good effort, mate.</i>
-[Max] Ah!
[David]<i> Hamilton wins</i>
<i>the Monaco Grand Prix!</i>
[engineer] <i>You drove</i>
<i>like a lion today, Max.</i>
<i>You gave it everything.</i>
<i>It was so, so unlucky.</i>
<i>-Really unlucky. You drove your heart out.</i>
<i>-</i>[Max] Yeah!
We deserved more.
[engineer] <i>It will come. It will come.</i>
[David] <i>Pierre Gasly</i>
<i>with a fifth-placed finish in the end.</i>
[Pierre] Thanks, boys. Was good.
The car was really super-fast.
[Christian] <i>So, Pierre, obviously,</i>
<i>he got a decent result in Monaco,</i>
but he was nowhere near
the pace of the lead group.
Being a really competitive guy,
I want everything to be perfect.
<i>Coming into a new team,</i>
<i>new people around me...</i>
<i>You need to be patient,</i>
<i>but it's also difficult at the same time,</i>
because I want this to be at 100%,
I want this to be at 100%.
I want myself to be at 100%.
<i>I just want it to come straightaway.</i>
[Will] <i>It's incredibly hard for Pierre.</i>
When you line up alongside Max Verstappen,
<i>even your best day</i>
<i>is gonna look like failure.</i>
[Christian] <i>Formula 1</i>
<i>can take over your life.</i>
Come on, then.
We're going to go see the helicopter.
[indistinct chatter]
[Christian] <i>For me, this year is busy.</i>
<i>Obviously, my wife's busy with</i>
<i>doing her stuff as well.</i>
Give us a hug.
-[Monty] Bye, Daddy, take care.
-See you later.
[Geri] Bye, girls.
What? Do you just want one of me?
[Christian] Come on, Geraldine. You'll be
late for your own fucking concert.
-Bye!
-Bye!
-Stop right now, thank you very much.
-[Geri] Thank you very much.
Somebody with a human touch.
Not...
-Hey, you!
-Hey, you!
-Always on the run. Gotta slow it down...
-Always on the run. I've got that.
[Christian]<i> Pierre, it's going to be</i>
<i>a make-or-break season for him.</i>
He will be putting pressure on himself
because he will, obviously, be looking
to gauge himself against Max.
And inevitably, the media will be
looking at, "How does he compare?"
-Hi, there.
-Ready?
Right.
<i>If he can find that confidence,</i>
<i>he's a very capable racing driver.</i>
<i>Whether he's at Max's level,</i>
<i>I don't honestly know.</i>
<i>Only time will tell if he's capable</i>
<i>of running at the front in Formula 1.</i>
I'm knackered.
-[Geri] Yeah?
-[Christian] It's a big weekend.
[Geri] Mine is like having to do
12 Monacos in the space of three weeks.
Yeah, and you get... You get
one or two weeks off between each...
I've gotta do it, like, one,
then day off, another two.
Actually, I've gotta do three in a row.
Just saying.
[whispering] I work harder. [chuckles]
[crowd cheering]
[engineer] <i>Pierre, pick up your pace.</i>
[Pierre] Yeah, I'm trying to.
Gasly is poor.
Right. But he's losing four-tenths...
...in the last two corners.
It's like...
Which, I think, you or I could do.
[Christian] <i>His pace looked quite a bit</i>
<i>off his teammate.</i>
-Okay, mate. Just keep building up to it.
-Okay. Yeah.
The more you relax, the faster you go.
-[Pierre] Exactly.
-[Christian] Yeah?
<i>Pierre spends an awful lot of his time</i>
<i>looking at data.</i>
<i>Too much so.</i>
<i>He's not driving on instinct.</i>
At this level, you can't do that.
<i>He needs to stop screwing his own head,</i>
<i>measuring himself against Max,</i>
<i>and let it flow.</i>
[commentator] <i>It's a beautiful day</i>
<i>in Montreal.</i>
<i>A spectacular setting</i>
<i>for the Canadian Grand Prix.</i>
<i>What a thrilling race we have in prospect</i>
<i>here this afternoon.</i>
[engineer] <i>Radio check.</i>
[Pierre] Radio okay.
[Will] <i>There's a frustration</i>
<i>that's building within the team.</i>
<i>That's a big pressure on young shoulders.</i>
<i>The difference that marks the greats out</i>
<i>is how they deal with</i>
<i>the big pressure moments.</i>
<i>They embrace that pressure</i>
<i>and it's those high-pressure moments</i>
<i>that you get found out at.</i>
[Pierre] <i>I'm feeling confident.</i>
<i>Things are gonna work out,</i>
<i>and then, you will see.</i>
[breathing heavily]
[David]<i> It's Sebastian Vettel that leads</i>
<i>from Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc.</i>
<i>Ricciardo is ahead of Gasly.</i>
[engineer 1] <i>Close up to Ricciardo.</i>
[Pierre] Okay, copy.
[engineer 1] <i>Push, Pierre. Push.</i>
[David]<i> Gasly starting</i>
<i>to come under pressure.</i>
-Come on, come on.
-Come on!
[engineer 1] <i>We cannot keep doing this.</i>
<i>Push, Pierre. Push.</i>
[Pierre] Yeah, I'll try to.
[engineer 2] It's a good start, Max.
Take your time.
[Max] <i>Okay.</i>
[Max] I still need to gain
six, seven seconds, right?
[engineer 2] <i>You're about three and a half</i>
<i>seconds shy at the moment.</i>
<i>Now press and hold the overtake button.</i>
[Max] Okay.
[all clapping]
[Max]<i> What I like about racing</i>
<i>is driving on the limit</i>
<i>of what you can do as a person,</i>
<i>but then, also, being so close</i>
<i>to the ground and being that quick,</i>
<i>overtaking and stuff.</i>
<i>Just confidence...</i>
<i>feeling...</i>
<i>and rhythm.</i>
[David]<i> Here's Verstappen.</i>
<i>He's up into sixth place.</i>
[engineer] <i>Push, Pierre.</i>
<i>Push, Pierre.</i>
[David]<i> Pierre Gasly is behind</i>
<i>by quite some margin.</i>
[engineer] <i>Close up.</i>
<i>Close up. Get past him. Quickly.</i>
[Pierre] Argh!
[David] <i>Lewis Hamilton wins</i>
<i>the Canadian Grand Prix!</i>
[commentator] <i>Max Verstappen charged up</i>
<i>from ninth to finish fifth.</i>
<i>But his teammate, Pierre Gasly,</i>
<i>slid backwards to eighth.</i>
[Christian]<i> Pierre, I forget the car</i>
<i>that he was stuck behind,</i>
<i>but there's nothing dynamic</i>
<i>about the drive.</i>
<i>We want the drivers to be heroes.</i>
<i>If he crashes a car, trying,</i>
<i>if he's going for it, I don't care.</i>
<i>What we don't wanna be doing is finish</i>
<i>in sixth or seventh or eighth or ninth.</i>
<i>That has no value to us.</i>
[chuckles]
Honestly, I remember
that weekend so, so much.
[Jean-Jacques] The first Grand Prix,
Formula 1 of Pierre,
for us, it's, uh...
it's very, very amazing.
[Pierre]<i> It's always fantastic</i>
<i>to have my parents around.</i>
<i>I don't really see them</i>
<i>so much anymore, you know.</i>
<i>I left home at 13.</i>
<i>All the time, I was in racing and karting.</i>
[in French] I really want to win
everything. I want to win every year.
[crowd cheering]
[in English] <i>It wasn't easy for my family.</i>
<i>They gave everything they had.</i>
<i>And they have been through</i>
<i>difficult situations just to support me</i>
<i>and try their best</i>
<i>to make my dream happen.</i>
[in French] It's Pierre's first
karting all-in-one suit.
He was only nine
when he started competition.
It is very precious to me.
He wore it all weekend.
He only took it off to go to sleep!
[in English] So... Okay.
<i>I've spent only one and a half years</i>
<i>in Formula 1,</i>
<i>and of course things are not perfect.</i>
But Max, he does the job perfectly,
always extracting everything
from the car, so...
<i>I just need to use that</i>
<i>and use the experience and the talent</i>
<i>he has to develop myself even quicker.</i>
[Christian] <i>The Red Bull Ring.</i>
<i>It's our home race.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[Christian]<i> We have a home crowd</i>
<i>and huge expectations that go with that.</i>
[announcer] <i>Max Verstappen is here!</i>
[journalist] Red Bull has a reputation
for being rather ruthless
with drivers who don't perform
at the level of their teammates.
Are you sort of worried?
No, not really. I think at the moment,
it's clear, you know.
No one is happy and I'm the first one
not happy with the performance.
Um... And then, yeah, that's not pleasant
and no one is happy about it, so...
You know, he's just getting a headfuck
at every race at the moment.
<i>Confidence then gets hit</i>
<i>and becomes self-perpetuating.</i>
<i>And the pressure just builds</i>
<i>and builds and builds.</i>
[indistinct chatter]
[man] They ask you a question
and sometimes you go on a bit.
You know, they can only ask
so many questions. So, you know...
So if you give a concise answer
then you're helping yourself.
[Pierre] Yeah.
[music playing]
How do you cope with this situation?
With the rumors
that you will lose your seat on--
-Yeah...
-Yeah, you're smiling,
but that's not a fact of smiling.
[Pierre] I don't have anything to say.
You know, rumors...
All the media, like, some of them,
I'd just like to tell them "fuck off,"
because some of these things are not fair.
<i>You know, a lot of people</i>
<i>try to break your dreams.</i>
<i>You gotta stay strong mentally</i>
<i>and keep going.</i>
Thank you.
[man] Fuck! That wasn't easy.
[Pierre] Yeah.
[man] You all right?
[Christian]<i> He's shown flashes</i>
<i>of real speed.</i>
That's what you're capable of.
<i>Now, it's a matter</i>
<i>of brushing himself down,</i>
<i>ignoring all the negativity</i>
<i>that he's getting</i>
<i>and to see if he can actually</i>
<i>realize the potential</i>
<i>that we know and still think that he has.</i>
<i>It's now down to him</i>
<i>to turn this situation around.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[engineer] <i>Max, let's get it done.</i>
<i>Let's do it.</i>
[Max] Yeah. I hear you.
[crowd cheering]
Come on!
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen</i>
<i>making it look easy out there.</i>
<i>Next up, Räikkönen.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[commentator 1]
<i>Verstappen now up into fifth place.</i>
[Max] Yes, boys. Come on.
[engineer] <i>Yes, boys, indeed! Nice job.</i>
[engineer] <i>Pierre, get past him quickly.</i>
<i>Get through.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Oh! And Gasly is</i>
<i>struggling to find a way past him.</i>
[engineer] <i>You can't stay there, Pierre.</i>
<i>Increase your pace.</i>
<i>Max, come on, mate.</i>
[Max] All good.
[David] <i>Max Verstappen is up</i>
<i>into the podium positions.</i>
<i>-And they absolutely love that!</i>
-[crowd cheering]
[David] <i>Max Verstappen manages</i>
<i>to clear Valtteri Bottas.</i>
-Come on!
-[Max chuckling] Yes.
[engineer] <i>Well done, Max.</i>
[David]<i> And he is back up</i>
<i>to second once again.</i>
<i>Verstappen.</i>
<i>There is no stopping him today.</i>
[commentator 1]<i> Pierre Gasly could well</i>
<i>be lapped by his teammate.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[commentator 2]
<i>There's the blue lights flashing.</i>
<i>Warning him he's about to be lapped.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>The leader, Leclerc,</i>
<i>is behind, Max right behind him.</i>
[commentator 4]<i> Gasly is duty bound</i>
<i>to get out of the way.</i>
[David] <i>Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>leads the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen behind him.</i>
[engineer] <i>All right, this is game on.</i>
<i>Game on.</i>
[man] Come on, Max!
[David]<i> Leclerc goes off the track.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen!</i>
[crowd cheering]
[cheering]
[David] <i>He leads the Austrian Grand Prix!</i>
[crowd cheering]
[engineer] <i>Mate?</i>
[Max] Yes, boys! Come on. Yes!
[engineer] <i>Absolute class of the field.</i>
<i>Awesome.</i>
[David] <i>Verstappen wins</i>
<i>the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>
[Christian] Amazing!
Amazing! Fuckin' hell.
-[Newey] We needed that one.
-[Christian] Yeah!
[Max] <i>Whoa, mate! </i>[laughs]
<i>Oh, God, great job, boys.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[all applauding]
[engineer] <i>P-seven, Pierre.</i>
<i>Max, one.</i>
<i>Pierre?</i>
<i>Pierre?</i>
[Pierre] Congrats to Max.
I screwed it up again.
[Christian] <i>Max, you drove a mighty race.</i>
<i>You are the man.</i>
<i>I mean, what a race.</i>
<i>We're so proud of you.</i>
[Max laughs] Two in a row, Christian,
at home.
Not too bad.
[Christian] Amazing. Honda's first win
as well, absolutely amazing.
[Max] Yeah, amazing job, guys.
[all laughing]
[Christian] Hey!
Great job!
Very, very good.
[Yamomoto] Super, Max.
Yeah, super.
[crowd cheering]
Oh, my God, that was epic.
Amazing.
[cheering]
[Christian]<i> Suddenly, things are coming</i>
<i>alive for us and we're fighting.</i>
<i>You know, the momentum is with us.</i>
[announcer] And now, Verstappen!
[imperceptible]
[all cheering]
[imperceptible]
Congrats.
I'm fucking fast, but at the moment
I'm so fucking slow.
Just got to find, like...
The right thing for me.
But I think there were still
some positives today, but...
I pushed too much at the beginning
when I was behind Räikkönen.
I pushed too much,
then after I caused a blister.
-Made things worse. But...
-[Christian] Yeah.
-Yep.
-That was...
Not great, but...
Max wins, so at least we know...
-We got a good car.
-[Christian] We have a good car.
<i>You know, it's hard on Pierre,</i>
<i>it feels like we've given him</i>
<i>a huge amount of time,</i>
a huge amount of effort
to try and make this work...
Congratulations.
[Christian] <i>And...</i>
he was promoted into that drive...
prematurely.
<i>You know, I can't keep</i>
<i>making excuses for him.</i>
You know, if they're good enough,
they swim, they survive.
<i>If they're not good enough...</i>
<i>The question is, who is the right guy</i>
<i>to be partnering Max Verstappen?</i>
-This is the living room.
-[Sophie] That's the dining room.
Dining room.
[man 1] <i>Red Bull's an impatient machine.</i>
<i>The question is, who is the right guy?</i>
[man 2]<i> It's such a dangerous sport.</i>
Holy jeez.
He would have given his right arm
to be in your position.
[man 3] <i>He aced that one brilliantly.</i>
-Can you win this weekend?
-Yeah!
[man 4] Whoa!
-[man 5] We'll speak later.
-You can occasionally kiss if you want.
Showtime.[producer] Yes.
[Pierre] I wanna know
that you guys say the truth or not, so...
[producer] Yeah.
That's why I just asked you
to know in which way it's being said.
[Pierre] I lost it.
[Christian] <i>The situation with Pierre,</i>
<i>it's frustrating 'cause I really feel</i>
<i>that we've got a car</i>
<i>that could beat Ferrari this year.</i>
But we've been running one-legged.
[Pierre] Fuck! Fucking hell.
No!
[Christian] <i>Finishing seventh or eighth</i>
<i>or ninth has no value to us,</i>
so we decided to release Pierre
from the Red Bull Racing seat.
At the end of the day, if you can't cope
with the pressure and scrutiny,
you're never gonna make it
at the highest level in Formula 1.
[Alexander Albon] <i>Truthfully,</i>
<i>not many people get the opportunity</i>
<i>to pursue a career in Formula 1.</i>
[praying in Thai]
[Alexander in English] <i>It's an expensive</i>
<i>sport from the beginning,</i>
<i>so, being a rookie,</i>
<i>I feel very lucky to be where I am.</i>
My name is Alexander Albon. I'm 23,
and I race for Scuderia Toro Rosso.
<i>I've got four siblings.</i>
<i>We're very close, so a big family.</i>
<i>My mom's Thai. Dad is British.</i>
<i>My dad lives in Malaysia now,</i>
<i>so I don't really see him that much.</i>
<i>But he comes to Silverstone, always.</i>
<i>You can only be one nationality</i>
<i>in motorsports,</i>
<i>so I did choose the Thai racing license.</i>
-[monk] Can I take a picture?
-[Alexander] Of course.
[monk] I just shared you on my story.
[Alexander laughs]
[Alexander] <i>My mom, she's been my number</i>
<i>one supporter from day one.</i>
[Minki] <i>When things were tough,</i>
<i>really tough, last year,</i>
I came here and, you know, we pray
and, uh, we asked for things
to change for Alex.
[Sophie] I'm making it really
good for you, don't worry.
Cool.
Let's go. Shall we go?
[Minki] Yes.
[Minki] <i>Alex is the head of the family.</i>
<i>The younger ones look up to him.</i>
<i>You know, ask for his opinion a lot.</i>
<i>So, he's very important to us.</i>
[Alexander] This is a Buddhist school.
I kind of wish I did it.
But my mum didn't take us to school.
Instead, she's busy
taking Instagram videos.
[all laughing]
[Alexander] Zoe, can you take this?
[Minki] That was a fluke.
Did you guys get that?
[laughing]
[Alexander] Is my phone here?
[indistinct chatter]
[Sophie] I'm going to paint my nails.
I live with my four siblings and my mum.
We rent this place, so it is quite small.
It will be a very short tour,
but, yeah, this is pretty much it.
-So, living room.
-[Sophie] That's the dining room.
Dining room. [laughs]
I have a bit of my trophies.
This one is from the World Championship.
There's a photo going around now,
of Max and I, in karting.
<i>That's when I won the World Championship.</i>
Basically, Max, Pierre,
<i>Esteban Ocon,</i>
<i>even Charles,</i>
<i>we were all racing in the same year.</i>
[Alexander]<i> We'd grown up together,</i>
<i>but that's not to tell you</i>
<i>when we put on our helmets,</i>
<i>we're nice to each other.</i>
I guess, in a way, good reminder
of where we've come from.
<i>Take it back 12 months ago,</i>
<i>I was in Formula 2.</i>
[Alex Jacques] <i>This is wall-to-wall drama,</i>
<i>the Formula 2 championship.</i>
[Alexander] <i>Formula 2 is very serious</i>
<i>for young drivers.</i>
<i>It's our way</i>
<i>to basically get into Formula 1.</i>
Formula 2 is the support race
for Formula 1.
<i>We race on the same tracks</i>
<i>and on the same weekend as Formula 1,</i>
<i>so the Formula 1 teams watch the race.</i>
<i>They see how you're doing.</i>
Guys who have been dominating tend to get
the opportunities in Formula 1.
<i>I went into that year</i>
<i>fighting for the championship.</i>
[Alex Jacques] <i>Alexander Albon</i>
<i>wins in Baku.</i>
[Rosamma] <i>What an incredible race.</i>
Yeah, um...
Been a really tough couple of years.
[announcer] <i>The champagne!</i>
[celebratory music playing]
[Alexander] <i>At the end of that year,</i>
<i>I came out third</i>
<i>and I didn't really have a team,</i>
<i>so I thought that was it.</i>
[all cheering]
[Alexander]<i> And then suddenly,</i>
<i>everything changed.</i>
[engine accelerating]
[Alexander] <i>I got the call up</i>
<i>for Toro Rosso.</i>
<i>It was a shock.</i>
[Helmut] <i>Since last year,</i>
<i>we've been watching Alex Albon.</i>
My name is Helmut Marko.
I work for Red Bull.
<i>Red Bull have two Formula 1 teams,</i>
<i>Red Bull Racing and then Toro Rosso.</i>
<i>We are trying</i>
<i>to give young people a chance.</i>
<i>That's part of the Red Bull philosophy.</i>
<i>And that's why we took Albon</i>
<i>to Toro Rosso.</i>
[David] <i>Alex Albon from pitlane to ten.</i>
<i>Didn't he do well?</i>
Immediately, he jumped in
and he did three very good races.
[Alex Jacques] <i>Here's Alexander Albon</i>
<i>on Pierre Gasly.</i>
<i>Gasly can't fight back.</i>
<i>Super move.</i>
[Alexander] <i>The first thing</i>
<i>they care about is if you're fast enough.</i>
<i>Of course, I'm wary that there isn't</i>
<i>that much time given to a driver</i>
<i>to showcase his abilities.</i>
[David] <i>Sparks flying.</i>
<i>Someone's got some damage.</i>
<i>Albon in the thick of it.</i>
[Alexander] <i>There's always a feeling</i>
<i>of expectation and pressure.</i>
[David] <i>Here comes Albon,</i>
<i>round the outside of Gasly.</i>
<i>Good stuff.</i>
[Alexander] <i>There's only 20 of us,</i>
<i>so you never know the next big talent</i>
<i>to come in the sport.</i>
<i>You never know the next rich person</i>
<i>to come into the sport.</i>
You know it could always be
your last opportunity.
<i>That's part of the game.</i>
[Christian] <i>Here at Red Bull,</i>
<i>Pierre Gasly has been our Achilles' heel.</i>
Now, at this point,
we need a driver that can deliver
and not make mistakes.
<i>A driver that's got</i>
<i>tremendous self-assurance,</i>
<i>a driver that will say,</i>
<i>"Fuck it, I'm going for it.</i>
<i>This is who I am."</i>
<i>Bang.</i>
<i>Deliver.</i>
<i>We'll give Alex Albon a run</i>
<i>for the remaining nine races.</i>
We're gonna put you in situ,
so we just have to shoot you
in a similar pose
because we're gonna remove that subject
and put you in place, basically.
Okay.
[Christian] <i>The decision was made</i>
<i>with Alex Albon</i>
<i>to promote him as the logical candidate</i>
<i>within the Red Bull program.</i>
So, you can smile even more.
Okay, good.
Alex has got nine races to demonstrate
that he's got the right qualities
to be a Red Bull Racing driver.
<i>Saying, "Okay,</i>
<i>if you do a good enough job,</i>
<i>the seat is yours in 2020."</i>
But he will need to be able to deal
with the pressure that goes with that.
[Alexander] <i>Feeling right now,</i>
<i>obviously, a lot of excitement.</i>
<i>I would be lying if I said</i>
<i>there wasn't a bit of nerves as well.</i>
<i>It's really cool.</i>
It's like an F1 car on steroids.
<i>Now I've stepped up to the big team,</i>
<i>of course, there comes expectation.</i>
<i>With Pierre, you can't really feel sorry</i>
<i>for people in Formula 1.</i>
<i>When you do get the chance,</i>
<i>you really have to make the most of it.</i>
<i>You have to be selfish.</i>
I've been given this opportunity,
but trying not to get too flustered
by it all.
<i>Thinking about it now,</i>
<i>12 months ago, I was fighting for a seat</i>
<i>and now I'm here, it's a bit crazy.</i>
-[Alexander] How are you?
-[man] So happy for you.
[Simon] <i>Alex Albon,</i>
<i>after just 12 races in Formula 1,</i>
<i>has now replaced Pierre Gasly at Red Bull.</i>
[fan] Congrats, Alex.
[Will] Pierre,
did you get any advance warning?
Well, of course. Um, uh...
I gather you're surprised by the decision,
but do you believe it was a fair one?
Um...
[reporter 1 speaking in French]
[reporter 2 in English] Do you feel
you have been treated in a fair way?
The thing is, there are many things,
but that should stay internally
and I don't really want to talk about it.
[camera shutters clicking]
Coming into Spa, there are a lot of talks
and there is a lot of trash talk as well.
<i>I've just stopped listening to all this.</i>
<i>I'm just focusing on myself,</i>
<i>making sure</i>
<i>that I deliver the best performance I can,</i>
and, yeah,
still developing myself as a driver.
<i>But when you lose your seat,</i>
<i>it's difficult.</i>
[producer] Any advice for Alex Albon?
[chuckles]
I think he's smart enough
to find out by himself.
-[Jonathan] How are you?
-[Alexander] Yeah, not too bad, thank you.
[Jonathan] Congratulations
on your elevation.
Cheers, thank you, yeah.
I just want to say this,
absolutely at the start,
that probably anyone in the next week
who writes something
-in a national British newspaper...
-Yeah.
...will make mention of that thing.
-Yeah, I know.
-What I'm saying to you is
tell me as little or as much as you want
and I will deal with it as well as I can.
But mainly this is an interview
about racing.
That's what we accepted
on our understanding.
Oh. Right.
I would suggest
that we work together on it.
This isn't going to be a one-to-one
about Alex's mom.
I can tell you that now.
[Jonathan] No,
there'll be an element of that.
I'm not trying
to cause a bother here.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
[Jonathan] I've got a job to do.
That's what I'd like to do.
Do that another day, then.
-[Jacques] Right.
-[Jonathan] Thank you.
-[Alexander] Cheers, guys.
-[woman] Thank you very much.
[Alexander] <i>See you.</i>
<i>The media love to find some stuff.</i>
<i>If you don't know the story, 2012,</i>
<i>that year was by far the hardest year</i>
<i>I've had in my life.</i>
Even now, I don't like talking about it,
to be honest, 'cause it's...
<i>It's more I want to ask my mom</i>
<i>if she wants to speak about it.</i>
[Minki] <i>Alex, he's been through a lot.</i>
<i>There was a time, a long time ago now,</i>
<i>that I wasn't with the children.</i>
[newsreader 1] <i>Minki Albon,</i>
<i>jailed for fraud.</i>
[newsreader 2] <i>Kankamol Albon,</i>
<i>jailed for six years in October...</i>
It was a tough period, obviously.
I was in court.
I kind of saw everything happen.
Saw her get locked up and taken away.
Yeah.
I need to pray.
[Minki] <i>Yes, I did wrong.</i>
<i>I've paid for what I've done</i>
<i>and Alex has forgiven me.</i>
She was in and then she got out mid-2015.
So, it was a tough period.
<i>I was 15 at that time</i>
<i>and I was the man of the house,</i>
looking after my siblings
and all that kind of thing,
when... We call it,
"When she was on her holiday."
<i>I was a Red Bull Junior driver back then.</i>
<i>But I was a bit of a lost sheep.</i>
<i>Just having to deal</i>
<i>with the pressures of family life</i>
<i>as well as actual racing life.</i>
<i>Just kind of going to races,</i>
<i>I didn't really have the right mindset.</i>
<i>And then I got dropped.</i>
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>the results weren't good enough</i>
and that was that, which kind of...
Yeah, I saw it coming.
<i>Then, obviously, to be dropped,</i>
<i>it's kind of like a big bomb,</i>
<i>where you just think,</i>
<i>"What are we going to do now?"</i>
Didn't have any money, of course.
<i>But I did have my Thai heritage.</i>
<i>So we found some sponsors in Thailand.</i>
How did you feel the ThaiBev
was support you about the race?
Uh, I'm really privileged,
I'm really thankful,
<i>now they're supporting me this year.</i>
[Alexander] <i>That was really the only way</i>
<i>I could ever have got back into racing.</i>
<i>Two years after everything happened,</i>
the results started to suddenly come
and I started to get podiums,
started to win races.
<i>I think that's where, 2012,</i>
<i>it made me a lot hungrier.</i>
<i>I realized how much I wanted it afterwards</i>
because it got taken away from me,
the chance of Formula 1.
[trainer] Three, two, one.
[commentator] <i>We're ready, we're set.</i>
<i>It's qualifying</i>
<i>for the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Twelve races with Toro Rosso,</i>
<i>and promoted to Red Bull</i>
<i>to become their 11th driver.</i>
[Martin] <i>Over the winter,</i>
<i>he was nowhere near a Formula 1 car,</i>
<i>and then he got in the Toro Rosso.</i>
<i>Now, he's in a Red Bull.</i>
[Alexander] <i>My mom, we're very close.</i>
<i>That's why</i>
<i>I always have my family with me.</i>
<i>It makes everything feel normal.</i>
<i>You're with the people</i>
<i>you've been with the whole time.</i>
<i>Because really, I wouldn't be driving</i>
<i>if it wasn't for them.</i>
<i>So, this transition to Red Bull,</i>
<i>it is a big deal for all of us.</i>
<i>And then, during the race weekend,</i>
<i>there's a lot of people.</i>
[press] Alex!
[indistinct chatter]
[Alexander] <i>And there's a big atmosphere.</i>
[all cheering]
[Alexander] <i>The pressure around you</i>
<i>starts to get very intense.</i>
<i>Before each session,</i>
<i>I quickly do a meditation.</i>
<i>The reason I meditate,</i>
it's that feeling of getting away
from Formula 1 a little bit.
<i>It's really good for clearing your mind.</i>
<i>You feel your whole body from head to toe.</i>
<i>And then, at that point...</i>
[engine revs]
<i>I do a lot of imagining the track,</i>
<i>envisioning what I need to do</i>
<i>to be my best,</i>
<i>so I'm as prepared as possible.</i>
[engine roaring]
[Alexander] <i>Reset and then go.</i>
[Christian] Okay, mate, have a good one.
There's no pressure on this at all,
so just enjoy it,
see what the car's like on the low fuel.
Okay.
[David] <i>On board with Alex Albon,</i>
<i>the sixth driver to be promoted</i>
<i>from Toro Rosso</i>
<i>and easily the least experienced.</i>
<i>Good job.</i>
<i>Keep pushing.</i>
[David] <i>Albon now crosses the line.</i>
[engineer] <i>Excellent, Alex.</i>
<i>Considering your preparation,</i>
<i>you're only three-tenths of Hamilton.</i>
[Christian] <i>Well done, Alex.</i>
<i>That was a good job.</i>
<i>The performance he put in</i>
<i>was mightily impressive,</i>
<i>but, unfortunately,</i>
<i>we've taken an engine penalty</i>
<i>and so, Alex, he'll be starting</i>
<i>at the back of the grid.</i>
[Alex Jacques] <i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>You're watching Formula 2</i>
<i>right here, right now,</i>
<i>in front of a huge crowd in Belgium.</i>
[reporter] <i>How much are you</i>
<i>looking forward to tomorrow?</i>
Obviously, points woummld be the main aim.
Something out of your control happens,
a yellow flag...
It's different. No, it's just different...
[crashing]
-[Alex Jacques]<i> There's a big crash there.</i>
-Holy jeez.
[Alex Jacques] <i>There's a car,</i>
<i>who's lost it on the way...</i>
<i>Oh, no.</i>
Oh, wow.
[indistinct chatter]
[Alex Jacques] <i>That's a horrible accident.</i>
Jeez, I hope that kid's good.
Okay, um...
Wow.
That's terrifying.
Um...
[Chloe] Oh, my God.
Who was that?
Uh, we're just trying to see who it was.
[Minki] Oh, my God.
-[Minki] Isn't that Nick?
-[Chloe] Oh, my God, it's Correa.
[Minki] And Hubert.
[Chloe] Oh, my God.
Alex is good friends with him.
[siren wailing]
[Minki] Look. The ambulance.
The crash is there,
so they're probably getting...
[Alex Jacques] <i>We can confirm to you</i>
<i>that it's Anthoine Hubert</i>
<i>and Juan Manuel Correa</i>
<i>who were involved in the crash.</i>
I've never seen an accident that bad.
[Alex Jacques] <i>We have a red flag</i>
<i>and the race suspended</i>
<i>after a very violent accident.</i>
<i>The medical car has been deployed</i>
<i>to the top of the hill.</i>
<i>And we keep our fingers crossed</i>
<i>that they are okay.</i>
[newsreader 1] <i>Motorsport is in mourning</i>
<i>following the death of a young driver</i>

<i>at the Belgian Grand Prix.</i>
[newsreader 3] <i>...shocked and saddened,</i>
<i>a sport mourning the loss</i>
<i>of one of its brightest stars.</i>
My dream is to reach Formula 1.
[Alex Jacques] <i>And we're under way.</i>
<i>Hubert has the lead.</i>
<i>What a brilliant start for him.</i>
[Hubert] <i>You reach Formula 2</i>
<i>and you're getting close to it,</i>
but you need to still work very hard
and perform well if I want to get there.
[Alex Jacques] <i>What a moment for Hubert</i>
<i>to take the chequered flag</i>
<i>and win his home event.</i>
[all applauding]
[Hubert] <i>Both parents following me</i>
<i>and helping me, as well as my brother.</i>
<i>Nineteen years,</i>
<i>we are doing this together.</i>
Hopefully, we can get to
reach our dream together.
[Alexander] <i>I would always say</i>
<i>Anthoine was one of the good guys.</i>
I saw the crash live.
<i>It does really affect you</i>
<i>because he was someone</i>
<i>who I've raced against my whole life.</i>
[Christian] <i>There's this realization</i>
<i>for all the drivers that,</i>
"That could've been me."
<i>You know, that is a comrade.</i>
It's someone's boyfriend,
it's someone son,
and, uh... they're not gonna be around.
[Pierre] <i>When you lose your best mate,</i>
you can't really describe
what goes through your mind
or even through your body, you know.
You just feel shit
and just can't believe this.
<i>When the crash happened,</i>
<i>I was in the paddock.</i>
<i>Straightaway, I understood,</i>
<i>when I saw the cars,</i>
I said, "Something really bad
must have happened."
<i>And at that time, I didn't understand</i>
<i>which drivers were involved.</i>
<i>I just saw my parents.</i>
<i>They were completely broken, in tears,</i>
<i>and yeah, they told me</i>
<i>that Anthoine had passed away.</i>
It's just...
To accept this, it's difficult.
<i>I've grown up with him</i>
<i>from my first season in karting.</i>
<i>I was racing against him,</i>
<i>but at the same time supporting each other</i>
<i>and really motivating each other.</i>
<i>From 13 till 18,</i>
<i>he was my roommate, he was my classmate,</i>
<i>slept in the same room,</i>
<i>went to the same classes,</i>
<i>trained every single afternoon together.</i>
<i>I knew he wanted as much as I wanted,</i>
<i>to be in Formula 1.</i>
<i>Yeah, it's just...</i>
If I think about all these years,
I've been growing
and becoming the person I am today,
uh, partly thanks to him.
[engine revving]
-[engineer] The track temp will help you.
-[Alexander] Hey, Christian.
-[Alexander] You okay?
-[Christian] Yeah, good. You all right?
Yeah, I'm okay, mate.
I think you had a tough one last night,
I'm sure.
Yeah.
But, you know, he was doing what he loved.
Honestly, last night,
it was really bad sleep.
-Yeah.
-I don't know...
Normally, I really don't...
[Christian] I slept about
two hours last night.
Yeah.
But you know what?
He would have given his right arm
to be in your position.
Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Give it everything.
Yeah, I will do.
[indistinct chatter]
[Alexander] But yeah...
[Minki] <i>All the mothers, they're scared</i>
<i>of their child being a driver.</i>
<i>But I believe in Alex</i>
<i>and I believe in fate</i>
<i>and I believe</i>
<i>that things will turn out well for him.</i>
[indistinct chatter]
[Alexander] <i>You have this build up</i>
<i>before the race,</i>
where you think nothing's really gonna...
You feel worried, actually.
<i>For us lot, for the drivers,</i>
<i>it wasn't easy.</i>
When you race at 300 kph,
it's just dangerous,
<i>and it will always remain</i>
<i>a dangerous sport,</i>
<i>but you can't think about it. Otherwise,</i>
<i>you just can't drive to the limit anymore.</i>
[Alexander] <i>But once the lights go out...</i>
<i>you just turn that negative doubt</i>
<i>into a positive.</i>
<i>This is your chance to show yourself.</i>
[David] <i>And we're racing in Belgium.</i>
<i>Albon darts out towards the inside.</i>
<i>Pierre Gasly</i>
<i>looking to the inside of the Renault.</i>
<i>Oh! Verstappen hits Raikkonen.</i>
<i>And there's chaos at the first corner.</i>
<i>Verstappen's got damage.</i>
<i>He's dropping down the order.</i>
<i>And Verstappen's in the wall!</i>
<i>He's out of the Grand Prix.</i>
It was a horrible start.
<i>We need Albon to deliver</i>
<i>week in, week out,</i>
<i>because on the days</i>
<i>that something happens to Max,</i>
<i>you've got a driver that's right there</i>
<i>to pick up the pieces.</i>
[engineer]<i> Alex, we are currently P13.</i>
<i>The car behind is Hulkenberg.</i>
Come on, Alex.
[David] <i>Here comes Nico Hulkenberg</i>
<i>in the Renault to the inside line.</i>
<i>Wheel-to-wheel and Hulkenberg's through.</i>
[groans]
[David] <i>Albon now down to 14th place.</i>
[engineer] <i>There's a long way still to go.</i>
<i>Keep pushing.</i>
Okay, Pierre, so, as discussed, we are P9.
Currently P9.
<i>Next one in front is Magnussen now.</i>
[Pierre] <i>Copy.</i>
Yes!
[David] <i>There's big smiles</i>
<i>for Pierre Gasly's family.</i>
[engineer] Alex.
<i>Get through as quick as you can.</i>
[David] <i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Alex Albon is struggling</i>
<i>to get back in front of Nico Hulkenberg.</i>
[Alexander] <i>At that point,</i>
<i>I was just feeling like...</i>
[sighs] You know?
<i>I know the team wanted someone</i>
<i>who can overtake,</i>
who can kind of show the speed of the car,
but I was genuinely stuck.
I felt like I can't get past.
[Martin] <i>So, Pierre Gasly gets dumped out</i>
<i>of the Red Bull team into the Toro Rosso</i>
<i>and here he is,</i>
<i>as the leading Red Bull car of the four.</i>
[David] <i>Gasly all over the curves,</i>
<i>trying to get alongside Sergio Perez.</i>
<i>Kimi Raikkonen is just ahead of them.</i>
<i>And they're gonna go three wide.</i>
[all applauding]
[engineer 1] <i>You're doing a good job.</i>
Push up.
[engineer 2]<i> Box. Alex, box.</i>
The Red Bull Racing car,
it's a very complicated car to drive,
so by the time we reached the pit stop,
he was still working it out.
Come on, Alex.
[David] <i>Alex Albon down to the chicane,</i>
<i>to the outside of Kevin Magnussen.</i>
[engineer 1]<i> Okay, Pierre.</i>
<i>You are doing a good job. 18 more laps.</i>
[David] <i>I think Gasly will be pleased</i>
<i>with his performance this afternoon.</i>
<i>Meanwhile, the man that replaced him</i>
<i>at Red Bull, Alex Albon,</i>
<i>is further down the field in 14th.</i>
[Alexander] <i>When things turn bad,</i>
<i>you have to focus your mind.</i>
<i>You get this really gritty attitude</i>
<i>towards driving.</i>
<i>You've got to just ride the roller coaster</i>
<i>and enjoy it.</i>
[David] <i>Albon following the Racing Point.</i>
<i>He's gone for it and he's through.</i>
Yes, come on!
Come on. Yes!
[clapping]
[engineer 2] <i>Good job.</i>
<i>Next one, Hulkenberg.</i>
Come on, Alex, come on!
[engineer 2] <i>Excellent. Keep pushing.</i>
<i>Car in front, Gasly.</i>
[David] <i>How about this for a battle?</i>
<i>Alex Albon on Pierre Gasly.</i>
[engineer 1] <i>Fighting for P10.</i>
<i>Albon behind us.</i>
<i>Come on, Pierre.</i>
[David] <i>And down the inside goes Albon.</i>
<i>Late on the brakes.</i>
<i>Gasly holds it round the outside.</i>
<i>Alex Albon riding the slipstream</i>
<i>of the Toro Rosso,</i>
<i>gets to the inside.</i>
[Martin] <i>Okay, it's game on now, isn't it?</i>
[David] <i>Ricciardo is Albon's next target.</i>
<i>Nothing doing there.</i>
<i>Goes for the cutback,</i>
<i>but again, Ricciardo's defensive.</i>
<i>Albon goes for it anyway. What a move!</i>
Yes!
[clapping and cheering]
[engineer 2] <i>You are doing great, Alex.</i>
<i>Well done.</i>
<i>Next car, Pérez.</i>
[David] <i>Whether he can catch Sergio Pérez</i>
<i>by the end of the race...</i>
<i>It's gonna be tough.</i>
[engineer 2] <i>Pérez, nine seconds in front.</i>
<i>Nine laps to go.</i>
<i>Keep pushing.</i>
<i>Six laps to go.</i>
<i>Four laps to go.</i>
[David] <i>That gap now between</i>
<i>Albon and Pérez just four seconds.</i>
[engineer 2] <i>Keep pushing.</i>
<i>Three laps to go.</i>
<i>Two laps to go.</i>
[David] <i>The gap is now down</i>
<i>to 1,7 seconds.</i>
[Martin] <i>This could go down</i>
<i>to the very last chicane of the race.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[David] <i>Up to the fastest point</i>
<i>on the circuit,</i>
<i>Albon sensed a dummy.</i>
<i>And he's through!</i>
[both cheering]
[David] <i>And Alex Albon is on his way home</i>
<i>to take fifth place in this race.</i>
[applauding]
[engineer 2]<i> P5.</i>
<i>Excellent work, Alex. Thumbs up, mate.</i>
[Alexander] <i>That was</i>
<i>a really good job, guys.</i>
[David] <i>Here comes Gasly across the line</i>
<i>to take home a couple of points</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>
[engineer 1] <i>P9, Pierre, P9.</i>
<i>Beautiful race.</i>
[David] <i>Gasly will be pleased with that.</i>
<i>For Alex Albon, that's a career-best</i>
<i>finish for him on his Red Bull debut.</i>
[Christian] <i>Well done, Alex.</i>
<i>Really very good.</i>
<i>P5 from the back of the grid. Well done.</i>
[Alexander] Yeah, thank you.
Still some work to do, though, for sure.
[Alexander] <i>I think they see</i>
<i>potential in me,</i>
<i>but this doesn't mean</i>
<i>that I have the seat for next year.</i>
<i>This is more of a test, really.</i>
And, yeah, we'll give it a go, we'll see.
[Christian] <i>I think Alex,</i>
<i>he's just stepped it up.</i>
And the relationship
could not have got off to a better start.
[Smith] Well done, mate. That was mighty.
Well done.
[Christian] <i>And it just injected</i>
<i>a whole bunch of motivation</i>
<i>into Red Bull Racing.</i>
<i>He needs to be within three or four tenths</i>
<i>of Max by the end of the year</i>
to be the right guy to be alongside him
for 2020.
[David] <i>It's difficult to put into words</i>
<i>the emotions around Spa today.</i>
<i>It's a weekend where the devastating low</i>
<i>of the death of the young F2 racer</i>
<i>and rising star Anthoine Hubert</i>
<i>has served to remind us all once again,</i>
<i>the risks taken to seek</i>
<i>the rewards in motorsport.</i>
[engineer 1] <i>You've done</i>
<i>a very good job today, Pierre,</i>
<i>very good job.</i>
<i>You should be proud.</i>
<i>[Pierre] Thanks, guys.</i>
<i>Only a couple of points,</i>
<i>but I'm happy to score it</i>
<i>for my friend, Anthoine.</i>
[engineer 1] <i>Copy that.</i>
[Pierre] <i>Whether you knew</i>
<i>Anthoine or not,</i>
everybody in motorsport
have been impacted in some way.
It was very tough and it was
a big shock to everyone, I think.
<i>It is strange. I think I've been racing</i>
<i>these guys since I was 13.</i>
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>you spend so much time together,</i>
<i>you have the same interests,</i>
<i>you have the same dilemmas.</i>
<i>When you're amongst these guys,</i>
<i>you feel like family.</i>
<i>And family is number one.</i>
[Pierre] <i>Whether you are in Formula 1</i>
<i>or whether it's Formula 4</i>
<i>or it's Formula 2,</i>
<i>you know, it's like we are all brothers</i>
<i>in this world.</i>
<i>When you lose one of your brother,</i>
<i>you feel the need to enjoy life</i>
<i>and enjoy racing and Formula 1</i>
<i>as much as he would have liked.</i>
These things happen to remind it to us.
You can occasionally kiss if you want.
[laughing]
[man 1] Start by holding hands.
-Can you win this weekend?
-Yeah!
-[man 2]<i> Vettel's undercut him.</i>
-[Charles] What the hell?
[man 4] <i>Oh, no! What's happened there?</i>
We can start drinking now.
It's five o'clock somewhere.
Nico!
Hulkenberg!
[laughing]
You are acting as a shrink for our couple.
[Alexander] <i>This is where I'm gonna have</i>
<i>my single life.</i>
[man 5]<i> It's very hard</i>
<i>to keep up with him.</i>
[Max] This is the best day of my life.Good morning.
Oh! My hand! Fuck me.
[country music playing]
Some country. Let's listen to some...
Let's listen to some country music, y'all.
What do you listen to?
-Rock.
-Yeah?
Like?
'70s and '80s. I love the '80s.
But you are more into
your "Señorita" stuff.
[chuckles]
I'm born in '97.
[Marc] <i>When you sign for Ferrari...</i>
<i>it's the pinnacle, you know?</i>
[all cheering]
I'm Sebastian Vettel...
driving for Scuderia Ferrari.
[Mattia] <i>Ferrari's a legendary brand.</i>
Ferrari have always been
part of the motor racing.
[commentator 1] <i>In the field...</i>
<i>Alberto Ascari in a Ferrari...</i>
[clapping]
[Marc] <i>Ferrari is a team who has won</i>
<i>more races and more world championships</i>
<i>than any other team.</i>
<i>Drivers become legends</i>
<i>when they win with Ferrari.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Michael Schumacher,</i>
<i>the seven-times Formula 1 world champion.</i>
[all cheering]
Michael was my hero in my childhood.
[indistinct chatter]
<i>Michael winning for Ferrari...</i>
[whistling]
[Sebastian] <i>...being a German driver,</i>
<i>coming to see us as kids</i>
<i>on the go-kart track...</i>
<i>getting to know him.</i>
He was always winning in the red car.
That's what I want to achieve.
That's why I'm here.
[Will] <i>Sebastian won</i>
<i>four world championships with Red Bull.</i>
<i>But Sebastian's move to Ferrari</i>
<i>coincided with the rise of Mercedes.</i>
[Martin] <i>It's high-fives</i>
<i>from Lewis Hamilton,</i>
<i>a five-time champion of the world!</i>
[Will] <i>Sebastian still doesn't have</i>
<i>a world championship with Ferrari.</i>
[Sebastian] <i>Still trying</i>
<i>to get to the top.</i>
<i>That's what drives me.</i>
We're still fighting,
and we're still believing.
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome along</i>
<i>to Austin, Texas,</i>
<i>ahead of the United States Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Around this 3,4-mile circuit...</i>
[indistinct chatter]
[Sebastian] <i>I'm certainly very proud</i>
<i>to be driving the red car,</i>
but so, I think,
is everyone else in the garage.
[indistinct chatter]
<i>The passion that the people have for</i>
<i>the brand is what keeps the myth alive.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Just three more</i>
<i>races to go,</i>
<i>and the title could be decided</i>
<i>this weekend</i>
<i>if Lewis Hamilton scores</i>
<i>a total of four points</i>
<i>in Sunday's 56-lap race.</i>
[Will] <i>2019 was the chance</i>
for Sebastian to draw level with Lewis
on five world championships.
<i>It has not quite worked out</i>
<i>as well as he'd hoped.</i>
And it's not just Mercedes
that Sebastian now has to fight with.
[engine revving]
<i>Sebastian now has his work cut out</i>
<i>within his own team.</i>
[in Italian] I woke up
at 5:50 this morning.
-What time did you sleep?
-Ten o'clock.
[commentator 3 in English]
<i>The big news this week,</i>
<i>Charles Leclerc will be joining</i>
<i>Ferrari next season.</i>
<i>The second-youngest Ferrari driver</i>
<i>in history.</i>
[engine revving]
I'm Charles Leclerc, and I'm driving
for Scuderia Ferrari in Formula 1.
[in Italian] Good morning.
I've arrived a bit early.
[in English] <i>Growing up, there was only</i>
<i>one team that was counting for me.</i>
<i>It was Ferrari.</i>
<i>Every time I come to a Grand Prix,</i>
<i>it feels extremely special.</i>
It's all I've dreamt for, really.
-[in French] How are you?
-Good, and you?
-Sleep well?
-Very well.
I woke up very early, but slept well.
Ready for today.
[in English] Ferrari has always
been a legend,
and we need to make sure
that the legend is surviving.
Our intentions as a team
is try to set a winning side.
[Will] <i>It's very unusual for Ferrari</i>
<i>to choose a young driver.</i>
<i>But after a decade</i>
<i>with no championship success,</i>
<i>perhaps trying something a little bit</i>
<i>different is gonna reap its rewards.</i>
[Mattia] <i>I think it's good as a lineup</i>
<i>to have an experienced and a fast rookie.</i>
I think that has been a great benchmark
for Seb as well.
[indistinct chatter]
Here you are.
Sorry.
[soft rock song playing]
[humming and singing along]
What's that? Are you...
What are you singing? You go quite high.
[Charles whistles]
Offspring. This was
when I was your age or younger.
[scats]
Punk rock... no?
[Charles] Uh...
I'm trying to listen, but...
[Sebastian] <i>Certainly,</i>
<i>we are at different stages in our career.</i>
He's very young.
I'm probably not very young,
but also not very old,
but considered older or more experienced.
[Charles] I'm very bad
with the '90s music.
I knew better the '80s earlier
than the '90s now.
[Sebastian]<i> We fight each other very hard</i>
<i>on the track, but off the track,</i>
I think I'd be disappointed
if there would be the wrong sort
of energy going around.
[engine accelerating]
[chuckles]
He loves it. Every morning he's asking,
"Rev it up for me, man! Rev it up."
["Come Out and Play" playing]
-[Charles] Beautiful parking, Seb.
-Yeah, unbelievable.
[indistinct shouting]
[crowd cheering]
The fans of Ferrari are just crazy,
so passionate.
[crowd cheering]
[Charles] <i>It's something</i>
<i>that you don't see anywhere else.</i>
<i>So much passion for one team.</i>
[cheering]
[presenter] <i>And big hand for</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc!</i>
[cheering]
Charles, you are getting
the biggest following around the world.
There is quite a big difference
from last year to this year on my side,
but that's how it is
when you drive for Ferrari.
We've got the best fans in the world,
and it's great to be driving
for this team. A dream come true.
And we will give our best as we can.
Ladies and gentlemen, Charles Leclerc!
[crowd cheering]
[Will] <i>The Ferrari drivers have been</i>
<i>on something of a journey in 2019.</i>
There has been friction,
there has been difficulty.
[indistinct chatter]
[indistinct shouting]
[Charles] <i>When I signed for Ferrari,</i>
<i>Mattia made it quite clear</i>
that Seb was the number one,
and I was the number two,
and on that I completely understand.
[indistinct chatter]
Despite that,
Charles has been quick from the outset.
[Martin] <i>Dearly beloved,</i>
<i>we are gathered here today</i>
<i>for the Italian Grand Prix</i>
<i>at the Temple of Speed.</i>
<i>Pole sitter, Charles Leclerc.</i>
<i>Hamilton and Bottas</i>
<i>now jockeying for position.</i>
<i>Leclerc goes into the first chicane ahead</i>
<i>by a matter of inches.</i>
[Charles] <i>In Italy,</i>
<i>Monza was absolutely crazy.</i>
<i>The whole country was behind us.</i>
Probably one of the first times
in my career I felt so much pressure,
<i>and I only had one thing in my head,</i>
<i>was to win.</i>
[Martin] <i>We haven't seen a Ferrari victory</i>
<i>in Monza since 2010.</i>
[Mattia] <i>Monza is a very special</i>
<i>Grand Prix in front of our fans.</i>
[all cheering]
<i>So, you've got the pressure</i>
<i>on the shoulders,</i>
and there is only one objective.
[commentator 1] <i>Leclerc and Vettel</i>
<i>are under pressure to pull off</i>
<i>something special</i>
<i>in front of the Ferrari fans.</i>
[engineer] <i>Charles, lap at 24,9.</i>
[Sebastian] Copy that.
[Martin] <i>That's Sebastian Vettel!</i>
<i>And he's spun!</i>
[car screeches]
[Martin] <i>He's coming onto the track</i>
<i>just as Lance Stroll goes past him!</i>
[Lance] <i>He just came back on the circuit</i>
<i>like an idiot.</i>
[Sebastian] I think I have damage.
The front left.
[Martin] <i>And there's anxious faces now.</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel's Italian Grand Prix</i>
<i>has gone from average to bad, to horrible.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Sebastian Vettel has</i>
<i>kind of opened the door for Mercedes now</i>
<i>to gang up on Charles Leclerc.</i>
[Martin] <i>He's going</i>
<i>for it again, Lewis Hamilton!</i>
<i>Got a great exit out of the chicane.</i>
<i>Round the curve they go!</i>
<i>Leclerc is on the inside!</i>
<i>Hamilton goes onto the gravel!</i>
<i>And you can hear the cheers from Monza!</i>
[all cheering]
<i>The Ferrari fans loved it!</i>
<i>Mercedes threw everything at him today.</i>
<i>Charles Leclerc has coped brilliantly!</i>
<i>He won in Spa! He wins in Monza!</i>
[Charles shouting] Yes! Yes! Yes!
[all cheering]
[commentator 1] <i>Charles Leclerc is the</i>
<i>winner of the 2019 Italian Grand Prix.</i>
<i>How about that?</i>
[crowd chanting] Ferrari!
Ferrari! Ferrari!
[Martin] <i>No, you are not dreaming.</i>
<i>You've just won the Italian Grand Prix</i>
<i>wearing that infamous red suit.</i>
[Charles] Yes!
[all cheering]
-[engineer 2] <i>P13.</i>
-[Sebastian] Okay, copy.
I took myself out of the race
in the beginning. Sorry for that.
[chanting] Ferrari! Ferrari! Ferrari!
[Charles in Italian] <i>Winning here</i>
<i>is ten times more emotional</i>
<i>than winning anywhere else.</i>
Thanks to all of you.
I don't have the words.
[journalist in English] Sebastian, I guess
it was just one of those days.
Well, not a particularly good one, no.
[crowd cheering]
[announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Charles Leclerc!</i>
[Charles] <i>To see so many people</i>
<i>was just absolute madness.</i>
It was probably the best day of my life.
[all cheering]
For Seb, Monza was frustrating,
because when you do a mistake,
and it was his own mistake,
it's always frustrating.
<i>I think certainly there is</i>
<i>a natural rivalry between the teammates.</i>
[Charles] <i>Seb's obviously the first person</i>
<i>you want to beat...</i>
because at the end,
he's the only person on the grid
that has the same car as yourself.
[Will] <i>If Seb thought that</i>
<i>it was going to be</i>
<i>a traditional master</i>
<i>and apprentice narrative,</i>
he's had a bit of a rude awakening.
[indistinct chatter]
<i>Seeing how quickly Leclerc developed</i>
<i>in his debut season with Ferrari...</i>
there is a massive prospect for fireworks.
[Martin] <i>Look at that!</i>
<i>Charles Leclerc flying out in front.</i>
<i>You can't restrain him!</i>
[engineer] <i>Charles, box. Box now.</i>
[commentator] <i>Ferrari have brought</i>
<i>Leclerc to pit,</i>
<i>that could give Vettel the advantage.</i>
<i>That was a quick stop for Leclerc,</i>
<i>but was it quick enough</i>
<i>to get out in front of his teammate?</i>
<i>Vettel's coming down the pit straight.</i>
<i>Vettel's gonna get ahead of Leclerc here,</i>
<i>there he is!</i>
[Charles] What the hell?
[engineer] <i>Charles,</i>
<i>it was the best thing we could do.</i>
[Charles] To be honest with you,
I don't understand at all.
[Martin] <i>Right at the front,</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel leading for Ferrari.</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel takes the checkered flag</i>
<i>and wins the Singapore Grand Prix!</i>
[crowd whistling and cheering]
[journalist] Was this scenario
discussed before the race?
Uh, no. No.
[Martin] <i>Leclerc leads, Sebastian Vettel</i>
<i>pulls over to the right hand side</i>
<i>and takes the lead!</i>
[commentator] <i>Leclerc will be</i>
<i>absolutely fuming.</i>
[Charles] Just for me to understand,
the situation was pretty clear, right?
[engineer 1] <i>Yes, Sebastian</i>
<i>will let you by next lap.</i>
[engineer 1] <i>Let Charles by.</i>
<i>Let Charles by.</i>
[Sebastian] Let's break away
for another two laps.
-[Charles] Well?
-[engineer 2] <i>Sebastian, let Charles by.</i>
[Sebastian] You can tell him to close up.
[Charles] You put me behind,
and I respected everything,
but now it's difficult to close the gap,
obviously. We'll speak later.
[Will] <i>Every world champion has</i>
<i>what I term an "inner bastard,"</i>
and it is that ability to make
the tough decision when you have to.
<i>Ayrton Senna once said, "If you no longer</i>
<i>go for a gap that exists,</i>
<i>you're no longer a racing driver."</i>
But for a driver like Sebastian,
that gap doesn't have to be physical.
It's a weakness,
it's a chink in the armor of your rival,
<i>and you take it, no matter what.</i>
<i>I think Charles is developing it.</i>
<i>But he is biding his time</i>
<i>playing the long game.</i>
[Silvia] Hello, everybody.
Now, a couple of things.
Seb versus Charles. There was a big
feature today in <i>La Gazzetta</i>
again saying you are against each other,
but I think they just need
to fill some space.
-[man] Yeah.
-[Silvia] We know you love each other,
so just tell people...
-You can occasionally kiss if you want to.
-No.
[all laughing]
I will not go that far.
-[Sebastian] We'll start by holding hands.
-[Silvia] Okay.
All right.
[Karun] <i>We're gonna see drivers</i>
<i>pushing out there today.</i>
[commentator] <i>Charles Leclerc is a man</i>
<i>who conceivably you think</i>
<i>could be on pole later on today.</i>
[engineer] <i>Try to increase the gap</i>
<i>to Magnussen in front.</i>
<i>And it will be mode push for last corner,</i>
<i>mode push.</i>
<i>Magnussen in front--</i>
[Charles] Something wrong with the engine.
[engineer] <i>Slow button on.</i>
<i>Slow button on.</i>
<i>Stop the car. Stop the car.</i>
[Martin] <i>Leclerc has pulled off</i>
<i>the circuit in the Ferrari.</i>
[engineer] <i>Engine off. Engine off.</i>
-[Charles] I'll get out of the car.
-[engineer] <i>Copy.</i>
[Martin] <i>And that is session over</i>
<i>for Charles Leclerc.</i>
[Martin] <i>It'll be a tough two hours</i>
<i>till qualifying.</i>
[Mattia] <i>You have no time,</i>
<i>really, to analyze.</i>
<i>You just need to react.</i>
<i>We need to make sure</i>
<i>that the car is ready for the quali.</i>
<i>Two hours is very little time</i>

[Karun] <i>There's still smoke coming out</i>
<i>of the airbox.</i>
<i>So much heat!</i>
-[in Italian] You know we lost oil.
-What?
Okay.
Something happened with the engine.
Stay in place.
[commentator 1 in English] <i>Charles</i>
<i>Leclerc's car is ready to go.</i>
<i>They've done a good job here at Ferrari,</i>
<i>getting that new power unit in.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>They've had to use</i>
<i>an older, used engine in the car.</i>
[Mattia] Sorry for Charles' morning.
But try to be sharp.
It will be very tight in the afternoon.
Let's enjoy. Today is the qualifying day.
It would be good to have a good result.
[commentator] <i>It's qualifying,</i>
<i>here in Austin, Texas,</i>
<i>for the 59th World Championship</i>
<i>Grand Prix in the USA.</i>
[all cheering]
<i>It's still the same old story,</i>
<i>who can get the fastest time today?</i>
[Martin] <i>Sebastian Vettel</i>
<i>starts a flying lap.</i>
[engineer 1] <i>Charles three seconds behind,</i>
<i>coming fast.</i>
[engineer 2]<i> Sebastian in front.</i>
<i>Sebastian's in front.</i>
<i>-3,198. Can you be faster than that?</i>
-[Sebastian] Copy, yeah.
[Martin] <i>Setting the world alight</i>
<i>is Sebastian Vettel</i>
<i>at over 200 miles an hour.</i>
[engineer 2] <i>Let me know</i>
<i>if you can go faster.</i>
<i>Question?</i>
-[Charles] I don't think I can.
-[engineer 2]<i> Copy. Understood.</i>
[commentator] <i>I'll tell you</i>
<i>who's on their back foot.</i>
<i>You've gotta say Charles Leclerc,</i>
<i>just trying to get a handle on this car.</i>
[Martin] <i>Out and across the line</i>
<i>comes Sebastian Vettel,</i>
<i>at 24,6, a personal best.</i>
<i>Where does it put him? Second!</i>
[Sebastian] Okay, guys.
[in Italian] Good work.
Thank you, everyone.
[Martin in English] <i>Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>remains fourth.</i>
[engineer 2] <i>P4, P4.</i>
[Charles] I've lost
so much in the straights.
Anyway, fourth.
[crowd cheering]
[cheering]
[presenter] <i>Please give</i>
<i>a massive welcome to Sebastian Vettel!</i>
[Sebastian] Thank you.
[cheering]
[Sebastian] God damn, I like America.
[crowd laughing and cheering]
In Germany, you know, in Germany...
In Germany, you finish second,
and they're like,
"What's the problem? What's going on?"
I always need to make excuses,
you know? So...
[presenter] Let's go back
a few races to Singapore.
That win made you the third
most winning driver for Scuderia Ferrari.
[Sebastian] Who is ahead? Michael and...
-Michael and Niki. Yeah.
-Niki. So...
[all laughing]
-Not bad names to be--
-No. Not at all. Not at all.
I'm... I don't know, I love the sport,
I love the number sides of it as well.
I'm always thinking that one day
I'll be in my rocking chair,
fat and chubby and old,
and then I can tell my kids, like,
"Look..." You know? "Look at the numbers."
[crowd laughing and clapping]
[Martin] <i>It's the Unites States Grand Prix</i>
<i>at the Circuit of the Americas.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton can clinch the championship</i>
<i>for the sixth time</i>
<i>with a good result today.</i>
[indistinct chatter]
What's up, bro? Congrats! You all right?
[Martin] <i>Ferrari are strangely becalm</i>
<i>so far this weekend.</i>
<i>They're not on pole position.</i>
<i>They are on the front row</i>
<i>with Sebastian Vettel.</i>
<i>They're on the second row</i>
<i>with Charles Leclerc.</i>
<i>But we've got an interesting race</i>
<i>ahead of us.</i>
[Mattia] <i>We know</i>
<i>it will be very difficult.</i>
<i>We know our competitors are strong.</i>
<i>They're very strong.</i>
<i>But as Ferrari,</i>
<i>I think that there are no limits.</i>
[commentator] <i>Leclerc has really burst</i>
<i>onto the scene this year</i>
<i>and Vettel maybe has had</i>
<i>his nose put out of joint a bit.</i>
[imperceptible]
-[in French] Good race.
-Thank you.
[Will in English] <i>Ferrari, they are going</i>
<i>through a re-building process.</i>
But when you are fighting
against a team like Mercedes,
<i>can you have a driver war...</i>
that doesn't run the risk of imploding?

[Will] <i>Sebastian Vettel,</i>

He sees his place as the number one.
<i>"And I'll be damned if I'm gonna give</i>
<i>that position up to my rookie teammate...</i>
<i>that a lot of people view</i>
<i>as being Ferrari's future."</i>
[crowd cheering]
[Martin] <i>It's takeoff in Texas.</i>
<i>Decent start from Vettel,</i>
<i>but Verstappen's got a better one.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen, he's already</i>
<i>wheel-to-wheel with Sebastian Vettel!</i>
<i>Verstappen has passed him.</i>
<i>Hamilton has passed him</i>
<i>and has made his way up into fourth place.</i>
<i>And you can hear the cheers of the crowd</i>
<i>who rather like that one,</i>
<i>thank you very much.</i>
[Sebastian] I've got some damage.
I don't know where from.
I didn't touch anything,
but I have understeer like crazy.
[Martin] <i>What's happening to Sebastian</i>
<i>Vettel out there? Has he got a problem?</i>
<i>And on the inside, Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>has now got past his teammate as well.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Sebastian Vettel's</i>
<i>not happy about that.</i>
<i>He's coming back at Leclerc.</i>
<i>But Charles stays ahead,</i>
<i>and he's getting away.</i>
[in Italian] He overtook him.
[commentator 1 in English] <i>It's a lock up!</i>
<i>Vettel is pushing to the absolute limits.</i>
[in Italian] There's a problem, guys.
[Martin] <i>Daniel Ricciardo on the tail</i>
<i>of Sebastian Vettel!</i>
[Sebastian] Something broke.
[Martin] <i>Vettel coming back</i>
<i>at Daniel Ricciardo!</i>
[engine sputtering]
[Martin] <i>What's happened there?</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel has massive problems!</i>
[Sebastian]<i> I think the suspension</i>
<i>just failed.</i>
<i>Yep, failed. Something broke.</i>
Yeah. I don't know what happened there.
Completely failed.
[engineer] <i>Try to avoid</i>
<i>the curb inside turn eight.</i>
[Charles] Why?
[engineer] <i>Just because Sebastian had</i>
<i>suspension failure there.</i>
<i>We are going plan B, but you need to try</i>
<i>to close the gap to Hamilton in front.</i>
[Charles] Yeah, copy.
[commentator 1] <i>It's up to Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>to bring this home for Ferrari.</i>
[engineer] <i>Okay. Four more laps.</i>
[Charles] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pushing.
-[engineer] <i>Head down. Try to pass them.</i>
-[Charles] Okay.
[commentator 1] <i>Here comes Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>adding another championship</i>

<i>He's got six up here in Austin!</i>
<i>It's Lewis Hamilton,</i>

[commentator 2] <i>Charles Leclerc</i>

<i>What a result with an old engine.</i>
[engineer] <i>P4.</i>
<i>You have done a good job. Really good job.</i>
[Charles sighs] Thanks, guys.
[Sebastian] <i>He's very fast.</i>
<i>I think he's proven many times.</i>
So he doesn't need to prove that anymore.
<i>As far as we are concerned</i>
<i>working for the team,</i>
I think we are pulling
in the same direction.
I accept the challenge.
[imperceptible]
[Charles] <i>It's been an incredible season.</i>
For me, at the end, it's my first ever
season in Formula 1
fighting for podiums, wins,
pole positions.
<i>The dream is to try and build a long term</i>
<i>relationship with the team.</i>
And, yeah, my future dream
is to be a world champion with them.
[Mattia] <i>I think we're really at the start</i>
<i>of our journey.</i>
In order to win, sometimes,
you need as well to take some risks.
<i>We are all very convinced</i>
<i>on what we want to achieve.</i>
We will not hesitate to be brave
for the future.
[Sebastian] <i>In the end, it's all about...</i>
<i>All about winning.</i>
Competing against the best,
that's one thing.
[indistinct chatter]
Trying to do it with Ferrari
is another one.
[man 1] When are we getting
the Renault team jet?
When you do your first podium.
-[man 2] Ooh.
-[laughs]
-[man 3] What are your best moments?
-[man 4] That's a very short list.
I am very funny, also very good-looking.
Nico Hulkenberg!
-[Claire] Am I still in the lead?
-You are.
Oh! [laughs]
Should Sir Frank Williams'
sack his daughter?
I feel like an idiot.
[man 5] This is where I'm gonna
have my single life.
[man 6] What the hell did you do?
[man 7] <i>This is the best day of my life.</i>But with Nico Hülkenberg at the team,
<i>they've come on in leaps and bounds</i>
<i>over recent years.</i>
[Cyril Abiteboul] <i>Nico has been part</i>
<i>of the construction</i>
<i>of the team three years.</i>
He decided to join the team
when we were P9.
[Nico] Whoo!
We've been P4 last year all together,
so he's really been part of that journey.
[engineer] <i>Absolutely brilliant, Nico.</i>
<i>That was beautifully judged there.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
[Nico] Thanks, mate.
[Cyril] <i>Nico is an extremely</i>
<i>experienced driver,</i>
<i>but he has never achieved a podium.</i>
[Will] <i>And for the other</i>
<i>driver at Renault,</i>
<i>Cyril, this year,</i>
<i>has employed the services</i>
of a guy who not only knows
how to get onto a Formula 1 podium,
<i>but who knows how to bring home</i>
<i>a Formula 1 victory.</i>
<i>And that's Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
[Cyril] <i>Our ambition, our target,</i>
<i>is to be the best at everything,</i>
<i>just like Ferrari and Mercedes.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[Cyril] <i>So, with Nico and Daniel,</i>
<i>that's a box ticked</i>
<i>in relation to driver lineup.</i>
<i>I think we have a team</i>
<i>that is definitely building its profile</i>
<i>and finally starting to believe.</i>
Showtime.
[crowd cheering]
[tires screeching]
[commentator] <i>It's the Canadian</i>
<i>Grand Prix, and amazingly,</i>
<i>we're only a third of the way</i>
<i>through the season,</i>
<i>so plenty more action and</i>
<i>possibilities of change to come this year.</i>
[Cyril] <i>Daniel joining the team</i>
certainly has contributed
to set the bar very high for this season.
We know we are racing,
but don't hesitate to have fun.
Absolutely.
-Life is too short...
-Absolutely.
...to calculate.
Thanks, mate.
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>outqualifying his teammate six-one</i>
<i>on Saturday.</i>
[commentator]<i> Yeah, he really has,</i>
<i>he's making the team his own.</i>
[Cyril] <i>Nico, this year is the last</i>
<i>year of the initial term of our agreement,</i>
so it's an important year
and he's got expectations.
[Nico] <i>For now, for me, home</i>
<i>is Renault and I feel pretty happy there.</i>
I think the relationship is very good.
<i>The love and the fire</i>
<i>is still burning, so...</i>
[Daniel] <i>I knew, coming to Renault,</i>
that I was going to go up alongside
with Nico...
<i>and I feel more than ever</i>
<i>he will be at his best.</i>
There's not... you know,
I don't think there's really any bullshit.
It's just...
May the best man win.
[crowd cheering]
[engines whirring]
[commentator] <i>Finally,</i>
<i>the green flag is waved.</i>
<i>Seventy laps ahead of us here in Montreal.</i>
<i>The Canadian Grand Prix is underway!</i>
<i>Ricciardo, a bit unstable, but he's okay.</i>
<i>Hülkenberg has started well</i>
<i>in the thick of it</i>
<i>as they go through the first chicane.</i>
[engine accelerating]
[crowd cheering]
[engineer] <i>Okay, Nico, been told</i>
<i>to target lap time of 16,5.</i>
<i>Danny's been given the same target.</i>
[Cyril] Nico has the pace to be just
as quick, if not quicker, than Daniel.
[Nico]
How was the last lap for Danny?
What pace is he on?
[engineer] <i>You are 1,5 tenths quicker.</i>
<i>Gap to Danny is 2,6 seconds.</i>
[commentator] <i>This is gonna get tasty,</i>
<i>quite feisty, between the two Renaults.</i>
<i>Well, I hope they'll be allowed</i>
<i>to race here. Why not?</i>
[Nico] I have to get closer than this.
What is the gap?
[engineer] <i>1,3 seconds to Danny.</i>
<i>Okay, Nico, been told</i>
<i>you need to hold position.</i>
Nico, we need to cool the car
and that means you need to open
a two-second gap to Danny.
<i>Nico.</i>
<i>Nico.</i>
[Nico] That's bullshit!
So, just tell me not to race, mate.
It's fine.
[engineer] <i>You are not racing,</i>
<i>you've been told to hold position.</i>
We need a two-second gap
to the car in front to cool the car.
[commentator] <i>The fight between</i>
<i>Ricciardo and Hülkenberg</i>
<i>seems to have backed off</i>
<i>a little touch now.</i>
[commentator] <i>Daniel Ricciardo finishes</i>
<i>sixth and Nico in seventh.</i>
<i>At last, a good result for Renault.</i>
[engineer] <i>Okay, Nico, chequered flag.</i>
<i>Brilliant job, mate, absolutely fantastic.</i>
[Nico] <i>I was asked</i>
<i>not to race Daniel, not to attack him,</i>
<i>which, obviously, as a driver,</i>
<i>is always frustrating</i>
<i>to get that radio call, you know,</i>
<i>from the team,</i>
<i>'cause we're here to race</i>
<i>and we want to fight</i>
<i>and we want to show</i>
<i>we're better than the other.</i>
The team is kind of under pressure
to secure a good result, you know,
and I just wanted to bring it
over the line, to bring it home,
which I see the point,
but I also see my frustration.
[engineer] <i>I know it's a bit frustrating,</i>
<i>but you did a fantastic job today, mate.</i>
<i>Absolutely excellent. Thank you very much.</i>
Um...
Yeah, I mean, we talked about it
at length after the race and...
It was just one of those things
that can happen, but, um...
Yeah.
There's not much more to say,
to be honest.
[indistinct chatter]
-All good?
-Yeah. Well done, mate. Congratulations.
-Thanks.
-Thank you.
-No worries.
-We're back in the race now.
Yeah. It's good for the team.
-[man] Hey, Danny.
-[Daniel] Hi.
[chuckles]
[Cyril speaking French]
-[in French] Thank you.
-Thank you.
-[man in English] Daniel, you all right?
-Cheers, man.
There is one thing that's very strong
in our team, loyalty.
Loyalty towards people and
loyalty towards Nico is extremely high.
<i>So, I wouldn't say that</i>
<i>he's suddenly been</i>
relinquished to a secondary role.
He's still the Nico of before.
[aeroplane engine starting]
[Nico] When are we getting
the Renault F1 team jet?
-[Cyril] When you do your first podium.
-[laughs]
[Nico] Ask him about his drivers,
what he thinks, if he's happy with them...
so far.
He doesn't dare to ask me directly.
So, you are acting
as a shrink for our couple.
We are not sure where we are going.
Is it a long-term thing?
Are you ready for this?
Are we ready for this?
[chuckles]
Oh, look, the sea.
[Cyril] And something I want
to do differently in future is...
We had to tell the two guys
at the end of the race
not to race each other,
but we are now in a position
where I think that we can let them race.
Not sure about this weekend.
We'll see how we are
in terms of competitiveness.
-Uh...
-[Nico] Yes or no?
Yes or no, but we'll know
just before the race.
We still have three days to go.
[interviewer] Is that all right for you?
-I'm not gonna answer that question.
-Aw!
[tense music playing]
[fans cheering]
[host] So, here we are. Home Grand Prix.
-How is your French coming along?
-[mutters]
<i>[in French] So-so.</i>
[in English] Hey! You got it.
Uh, Nico, and how's your French?
Yeah. Just as good as Daniel's.
Sounds it.
And Alain Prost, ladies and gentlemen.

When you have a team, two drivers...
your main competitor

<i>Long live France, long live France.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[host in English]
Having moved away from home...
[crowd chanting] Daniel!
[Alain] <i>Talking only about the drivers,</i>
<i>for sure, we have to be careful</i>
<i>that we do not have a number one</i>
<i>and a number two.</i>
<i>That does not exist</i>
<i>and we don't want to have that.</i>
[Daniel] What's your dream, Cyril?
[crowd] Ah!
[in French] That's easy... Easy.
To win with these two boys.
[Alain in English]<i> But it's difficult</i>
<i>when you have two drivers</i>
<i>because, to be equal,</i>
<i>to treat the people in the equal way...</i>
<i>-You know?</i>
-[host] Question for Daniel.
Daniel, how do you feel
being the funniest driver on the grid?
Thank you. I'm very funny. I agree.
Uh, also very good-looking.
I worked on that for a long time.
Uh, but without surgery. Just with age.
Like a fine wine. Like a French wine.
-[Cyril] The nose, maybe, Daniel.
-Beautiful.
-[Cyril] The nose.
-Yeah!
[Daniel] Maybe the nose
could do with some work.
[chuckles]
[host] Ladies and gents,
please put your hands together.
Thank the guys for coming out.
Wish Renault luck this weekend
and for the rest of the season.
[crowd cheering]
Thank you very much! <i>Merci!</i>
<i>-Merci. Merci.</i>
-Thank you.
[host] <i>Danke schön.</i>
And...
[Will] <i>Nico Hülkenberg</i>
<i>holds the unenviable record</i>
<i>of the longest career in Formula 1</i>
<i>without having ever stepped on a podium.</i>
<i>As a driver so used to success</i>

to have never stood
on a Formula 1 podium has got to hurt.
What are you doing? What do you want, huh?
We need to talk, you and I?
Hmm?
And there's no way
he doesn't think about it.
What's the next thing now?
[exhales]
[Nico] Come on, homie,
show me what you have.
[Daniel in funny accent] Nico Hülkenberg.
-That came down really well. "Hülkenberg."

Aww, is... I mean, the first thing
that comes to my mind is Le Mans.
Was it one of your best?
I suppose so, in racing, yeah.
-I mean...
-GP2 championship.
I haven't won anything here,
so what can I say?
-Yeah.
-[imitating Ricciardo] Yeah!

Asshole.
It's okay. I remember that feeling.
[indistinct chatter]
[gasps]
Oh, my God! [chuckles]

[Daniel] <i>Naturally, you don't want</i>
<i>a teammate to be the next best thing</i>
<i>and ruin your career early.</i>
[whistles] I like avocado.
<i>You know,</i>
<i>if that teammate kicks your ass,</i>
<i>then, yeah,</i>
<i>your career can be in jeopardy,</i>
<i>so there might always be a little threat</i>
<i>whenever you have a new teammate.</i>
-Now you have to pay.
-Yeah, I know.
<i>It's hard to feel sorry for a competitor.</i>
<i>Maybe there's been people</i>
<i>luckier than him,</i>
<i>but there's certainly been a lot of people</i>
<i>more unlucky, so...</i>
<i>All of us are in it for ourselves,</i>

<i>It's also business.</i>
<i>It's how it works.</i>
[man] <i>Bon appétit.</i>
<i>Bonne journée!</i>

It's five o'clock somewhere.
[crowd cheering]

[Nico] <i>Daniel, I mean,</i>

Racing in front of your home public,
in your home country,
<i>it's important to do as good as you can.</i>
<i>But, obviously,</i>
<i>you have this huge pressure</i>
<i>to improve the performance of the team.</i>
<i>Canada was clearly good news,</i>
<i>but the start of the season has been</i>
probably the most challenging experience
in my career so far.
We had an objective
to be closer to the top teams this year.
We had a good season last year.
We finished fourth in the championship.
<i>But this year, we are not performing well.</i>
[commentator]<i> Just over 20 minutes</i>
<i>to lights out here in France.</i>

<i>the calm before the storm.</i>
[Cyril] <i>Bonjour.</i>
-All good?
-Think so, yeah.
-[Cyril] Smiling?
-Smiling, yeah.
[Cyril] Okay.
When I'm upset, I say it,
but when I smile, I smile.
So, let's enjoy it.
[Will] <i>Of course, Cyril's under pressure.</i>
But particularly so when you promised
to take your team back to the top.
[commentator]<i> Big pressure on this race</i>
<i>for Renault. Their home Grand Prix.</i>
[engines revving]
[commentator] <i>We're racing in France!</i>
<i>Daniel has to go for it today.</i>
[engineer] So, gap to Gasly is 1,1.
Do you want to clear him quickly?
<i>So, we have scenario one available</i>
<i>if you need to.</i>
[Daniel] Okay.
Yes! Come on! Whoo!
[engineer] <i>Grosjean's next,</i>
<i>he's doing 39,1.</i>
Okay, nice job, mate.
<i>Box to overtake.</i>
[Daniel] <i>Understood.</i>
[engineer]<i> Let's keep your status up now.</i>
-[Nico] How many laps to go?
-[engineer]<i> Two more laps.</i>
[Nico] Oh, man.
What a bitch, this traffic.
[commentator] <i>Lando Norris has got</i>
<i>to defend for all his might here</i>
<i>with two Renault cars</i>
<i>chasing after the McLaren.</i>
<i>And here comes Daniel Ricciardo!</i>
<i>Hard competitive racing from Ricciardo.</i>
<i>Oh! He's going wide now.</i>
<i>Oh, I would suggest the stewards</i>
<i>are gonna take a look at this.</i>
[engineer] <i>P7. Well done, mate,</i>
<i>well done. P7.</i>
[man] Shit. That might be dodgy.
He's off the track.
[engineer] That...
We're gonna get five...
We could get five seconds for that.
-Yeah.
-[man] That's gonna fuck everything.
[Cyril] That's what I thought.
[in French] <i>We will be penalized</i>
<i>because all four tires were off the track.</i>
<i>We are losing our standing.</i>
-[man] <i>We are losing our standing?</i>
<i>-We will be losing five seconds</i>
<i>and five seconds will mean ten.</i>
[commentator in English] <i>Ultimately, it's</i>
<i>another disappointing result for Renault.</i>
<i>With Ricciardo stripped of his points,</i>
<i>the team are still stuck in fifth place.</i>
[Cyril] <i>We underdelivered,</i>
<i>underperformed, and it's tough to accept.</i>
The harsh reality,
that's coming back to you.
<i>I know that if I don't deliver,</i>
<i>my life expectancy is very limited.</i>
<i>So, that pressure requires me,</i>
<i>as a leader,</i>
<i>to make sure that we make</i>
<i>some strategic decisions for the future.</i>
[Will] <i>Cyril's going to have to make</i>
<i>a decision.</i>
<i>They have one superstar driver locked in</i>
<i>for two seasons in Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
So, if they wanna make a change
on the driver front,
<i>there's only one place</i>
<i>that they can do that.</i>
[reporter] <i>Moving into 2020, uh,</i>
what does this mean
for your driver situation in the future?
Well, no, you know,
frankly, the situation is clear.
We have a two-year contract with Daniel.
Uh...
Nico's contract initial term is coming
to an end at the end of this year,
but we need to look at the options,
like everyone is doing.
[reporter] And to follow up on that,
is there any chance
you wanna have another look
-at having Esteban Ocon in the team?
-[chuckles]
[upbeat music playing]
This year,
I'm the reserve driver for Mercedes.
[host] Esteban Ocon!
Toto Wolff from Mercedes!
[crowd cheering]
[Esteban] <i>Toto is the team principal,</i>
<i>but he is also managing me.</i>
Esteban, when will you
drive a Formula 1 car?
Definitely, there are a lot of talks
at the moment, so...
Everything is following its path
and hopefully, you know,
we will find a way
<i>and I will be back in a race car</i>
<i>very soon.</i>
[commentator] <i>Now, here comes Esteban Ocon</i>
<i>in the Force India.</i>
[Esteban]<i> 2018, of course,</i>
<i>was not a great end of the season. Um...</i>
[commentator] <i>Perez gets past Ocon</i>
<i>as they now accelerate</i>
<i>towards the fastest part of the circuit.</i>
<i>And the two Force Indias made contact!</i>
[commentator] <i>Once again,</i>
<i>they have touched.</i>
[Esteban] Guys, what the fuck?
<i>Unfortunately, I lost the seat for 2019.</i>
I'm so hungry to get back
because it's been so long
since I have been on the grid.
For us, it is always
about setting the right objectives.
And last year, we were promised a contract
for Esteban with Renault.
<i>And then suddenly, Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>made himself available.</i>
<i>So, it didn't happen.</i>
[Esteban] <i>When you're out...</i>
<i>you can be out forever.</i>
-[man] Silly season.
-I didn't hear your silly question.
-Can you repeat it?
-[man] Yeah. [chuckles]
What's silly season?
I don't know. [scoffs]
You define silly season.
What is silly season?
[man] I don't know.
I'm not from this world.
No? Me neither.
-I just...
-[both chuckling]
It's when everyone mingles.
You know, it's that game
when everyone's standing up,
walking around the chairs
and as long as the music's up,
you're walking,
and then when the music stops,
you need to sit down as fast as possible
and take a seat.
That's the game we're playing right now.
-[man] Is it happening now?
-It's happening right now.
[Toto in French] <i>Hi, Cyril.</i>
<i>What are you doing this evening?</i>
[in English] Oh, okay.
[in French] <i>When are you leaving?</i>
<i>What about dinner?</i>
<i>Yes, that's a good idea.</i>
<i>Listen, I've got the cameras on me,</i>
<i>by the way, right now.</i>
<i>You know I've got Esteban in the car</i>
<i>with me.</i>
<i>But don't worry,</i>
<i>he doesn't know what we're talking about.</i>
<i>Esteban, do you want</i>
<i>to ask Cyril anything?</i>
<i>You know what I want to ask him.</i>
<i>He says,</i>
<i>"You know what I want to say to him."</i>
<i>Okay. Let's talk later. Bye.</i>
[man in English]
There's loads of rumors, always,
isn't there? I mean, I heard--
-I love rumors.
-[man] Yeah!
I mean,
I heard Ocon replacing you at Renault.
Those things.
What do you think about all those rumors?
Just part of the game, part of F1,
during that silly season, somehow.
[man] But what's your prediction?
What do you think will happen with you?
No prediction for now.
This weekend, let's perform.
As always, the most important thing
is you need to perform.
Then you're attractive and sexy.
You're really breaking my balls here, man.
-[man] I know. I know.
-Fucking hell.
-[man] Haven't even had breakfast yet.
-Yeah.
You can be lucky.
I had my first coffee,
otherwise you'd be right out the window.
[both laugh]
[commentator] <i>A very wet day</i>
<i>here in Hockenheim.</i>
[commentator] <i>If there is one driver</i>
<i>who can take advantage </i>
<i>of the poor conditions today,</i>
<i>gotta say, Nico Hülkenberg.</i>
<i>It's his home race.</i>
It's good because we followed your advice,
to stay out or something like that.
-When?
-Last year, here.
Yeah, but it was only a few drops.
[commentator] <i>So, we've had huge rain</i>
<i>overnight and this morning as well.</i>
<i>Light rain for the next half an hour</i>
<i>to an hour is the message.</i>
<i>Anything could happen</i>
<i>here in the rain today.</i>
[Nico] <i>To take the podium</i>
<i>is what I've been dreaming about</i>
<i>and worked towards</i>
<i>since I'm eight years old.</i>
<i>I think I have what it takes</i>
<i>to put a car...</i>
You know, onto the podium.
<i>Just need to be ready, um, focused.</i>
Perfect.
Nico, this year, is the last year
of the initial term of our agreement.
<i>But there is also an option in place</i>
<i>so that we can continue</i>
<i>our journey together.</i>
And that's why I know that, uh,
in everything that's happening
on track and off track,
he's got that in the back of his mind.
[Nico] <i>If I get onto the podium,</i>
there's options to continue with Renault.
<i>I know what I have to do.</i>
<i>This is my last chance.</i>
[commentator] <i>And it's lights out</i>
<i>and away we go. It's a tentative start.</i>
<i>No grip whatsoever.</i>
<i>Hülkenberg's down in eighth place.</i>
<i>Down the inside goes the Renault</i>
<i>of Nico Hülkenberg and Romain Grosjean</i>
<i>and Hülkenberg and Grosjean touch.</i>
[Nico] I had contact with the Haas.
But I think the front is okay.
[engineer] Copy, Nico.
[commentator]<i> Oh! Off the road, there.</i>
<i>The McLaren is off</i>
<i>and Carlos Sainz has gone off the track.</i>
[Nico] <i>The track was wetter.</i>
You know,
those races always tend to be crazy
and very eventful.
[commentator] <i>Charles Leclerc's</i>
<i>going for it down</i>
<i>on the inside into turn one.</i>
<i>Magnussen cutting behind him.</i>
<i>Leclerc's gone a bit wide, but he's ahead.</i>
[engineer] <i>Nico, if you've got any pace</i>
<i>in hand, we need to use it now.</i>
[commentator] <i>And now the Renault of Nico</i>
<i>Hülkenberg says, "Thank you very much,</i>
<i>Charles Leclerc,</i>
<i>you've just earned me a place, there."</i>
[engineer] Nice work, Nico.
You are now P7.
[engineer] <i>Okay, Daniel.</i>
<i>How's the track? How's the track?</i>
[Daniel] Struggling still.
Locking the left front.
[engineer] Okay, understood.
[engineer] <i>So, gap to Raikkonen unchanged.</i>
<i>Okay, Nico, overtake is available.</i>
<i>Nice work, Nico.</i>
So, you are P5, mate.
Great job so far.
[commentator] <i>That is Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>and that looks like</i>
<i>a massive engine problem.</i>
[Daniel] I have a lot of smoke
coming out.
[engineer] <i>Yeah, we may have</i>
<i>an exhaust leak.</i>
<i>Stop the car, please, stop the car.</i>
[Daniel] Yeah, it's shut off.
[commentator] <i>And not much really to say</i>
<i>about that for Renault.</i>
[engineer] <i>Okay, Nico,</i>
<i>so you are P4 now, P4.</i>
[Nico] <i>Yeah, I was performing very well.</i>
<i>I had a really strong pace.</i>
I was well up in the field.
[engineer] <i>The rain</i>
<i>is getting a bit heavier, Nico.</i>
<i>If you're happy to stay on these tires,</i>
<i>then that's good for us.</i>
[Nico] Yeah, I think you're right.
[Cyril]<i> The team at that moment,</i>
<i>making all the right decisions,</i>
<i>perfectly in sync between the elements,</i>
the weather, the track conditions,
the driver, pit wall.
[commentator] <i>Bottas is into the pit.</i>
[engineer] <i>Okay, Nico,</i>
<i>you are currently P2.</i>
<i>Bottas had to stop for tires.</i>
<i>He's behind us now.</i>
[Cyril]<i> I started to realize</i>
<i>Nico is on track for the podium.</i>
This is the time.
[commentator] <i>Nico Hülkenberg, in his home</i>
<i>Grand Prix, running in second place.</i>
[commentator] <i>Still just in that</i>
<i>tantalizingly close podium position</i>
<i>he's never been able to achieve.</i>
[commentator] <i>I so want Nico Hülkenberg</i>
<i>to finish on the podium.</i>
<i>He deserves a podium finish.</i>
<i>Maybe, just maybe.</i>
[Nico] <i>To take the podium</i>
<i>is what I've been dreaming about</i>
<i>and working towards</i>
<i>since I'm eight years old.</i>
[engineer] <i>Okay, let's stay focused.</i>
<i>Great job so far.</i>
<i>So, you got Verstappen,</i>
<i>who is the race leader, in front of you.</i>
Watch out for possible oil on the track.
[Nico] I'm a bit cautious with turn ten.
It's very dangerous here.
[engineer] <i>Copy that, Nico.</i>
[commentator] <i>It's Verstappen losing it!</i>
[man] Oh!
[Nico] Verstappen spun in front of me.
[engineer]<i> So, Verstappen has lost</i>
<i>four seconds to you.</i>
[Nico] Okay then, I think it's time to go.
[engineer] <i>Car looks good to us, Nico.</i>
<i>You're doing an excellent job,</i>
<i>there, Nico.</i>
[commentator] <i>Look! There is the Renault</i>
<i>of Nico Hülkenberg in the barriers.</i>
<i>And he's ending his home Grand Prix.</i>
[Cyril] <i>Uh... and that was it.</i>
Any chance of maybe of a podium,
gone in one blink of a second.
[Nico] <i>I put my wheels, you know,</i>
<i>across that curb,</i>
<i>and as soon as I went</i>
<i>onto that black tarmac,</i>
I knew that I was fucked.
<i>You know, and that moment was...</i>
Yeah, it was very detrimental. Uh...
<i>Yeah. I don't know how to describe it,</i>
<i>but it was... It was super difficult.</i>
That's something that was in his control.
He was driving the car.
<i>So, you can't blame the elements,</i>
<i>you can't blame another driver,</i>
<i>you can't blame the car.</i>
[man] Shame.
[man] Next time.
The one that got away.
[Cyril] Sometimes,
I wish it would go away.
-Sorry?
-[Cyril] Sometimes, it could go away.
Yeah.
I know, it's always bad luck.
And the fact that podium, once again,
became unavailable to him,
I started to think
that maybe there is a curse...
<i>or something between him</i>
<i>and that top-three finish.</i>
For the 2020 season,
we decided not to renew Nico's contract
and give the seat to Esteban Ocon.
Cyril, once you'd decided on Daniel,
were you always thinking
you'd come back for Esteban
at the end of this year?
-Can I say something before we start?
-[reporter] Yes, of course.
I'm really happy to have Cyril here.
-Um...
-[all chuckle]
Not me?
No, you, I had all the time.
Very difficult to make your way
into the top three,
but that's obviously
what we are striving to do,
and I do believe that Esteban can help us
in doing that.
<i>-Merci.</i>
-[man] Thank you.
<i>Merci.</i>
I've always been looking up
to Formula 1 and aspiring to it,
then I've done it for ten years,
and now it's a solid stop.
<i>It will be quite a shock</i>
<i>to the system, obviously.</i>
<i>So, yeah, it's gonna be interesting</i>
<i>to see how I cope with that.</i>
[Claire Williams] This is all we did
at home when we were growing up.
[George Russell] <i>I feel like</i>
<i>we're amateurs.</i>
<i>We need to seriously pull our fingers out.</i>
[Will]<i> Paddy Lowe was supposed to</i>
<i>have designed a great car and he didn't.</i>
See you later, Paddy.
This is my place.
Obviously, got an amazing view.
Coming back in Toro Rosso,
I didn't feel like that was really fair.
[crowd cheering]
I've fully deserved the seat.
-[man yells]
-[all screaming]
[man] Fuck off!
[dramatic music playing]Bye.
[in sing-song voice] Silverstone...
I love Silverstone. I just love it.
<i>I think there's something incredibly</i>
<i>spiritual almost about Silverstone. </i>
<i>It really holds a very special place</i>
<i>in my heart.</i>
I want to have my ashes
spread at Silverstone.
You know that, don't you?
[Jonathan] I do now.
-I thought I told you.
-[Jonathan chuckles] No.
[both laughing]
I think Dad does as well.
<i>Over my childhood,</i>
<i>I really understood how famous my dad was,</i>
<i>and how big Williams was.</i>
<i>It's just been the venue of so many</i>
<i>historic moments for our team.</i>
<i>That was our heyday.</i>
[crowd cheering]
<i>Dad's always been my hero.</i>
Dad's got two laps to try
and convince you to come to Williams.
[all laughing]
[Claire] <i>He is Williams.</i>
I don't wanna disgrace the Williams name.
I don't want Williams to fall apart
under my watch.
<i>We have a fighting spirit,</i>
<i>and it's really being put to the test,</i>
<i>but I can tell you it's 100% back.</i>
Ladies and gentlemen, please put it
together for Claire Williams.
[crowd cheering]
[indistinct chatter]
-That's like it. You got that?
-[man] I did.
Lovely. Thrilled to bits.
-[kisses]
-You're the best.
-[Frank] Bless you, Clairy.
-[Claire] See you later.
-Silverstone.
-[Claire] Yeah.
<i>I'm deputy team principal,</i>
<i>which has really turned into</i>
<i>de facto team principal.</i>
<i>My dad's taken a step back</i>
<i>in the past few years,</i>
<i>and so really, I operate</i>
<i>as the team principal.</i>
Morning, Gwen. How are you doing?
<i>I'm responsible for making sure</i>
<i>that we've got the right people</i>
<i>in the right jobs,</i>
<i>with the right equipment to do those jobs.</i>
<i>And to make sure that this is a great</i>
<i>environment for people to work in.</i>
<i>I'm very protective over it.</i>
<i>Obviously, it's very close to my heart.</i>
I'm sorry I didn't make it down.
It was a busy day yesterday.
Was it? I was looking forward
to you coming down. [chuckles]
[Claire] <i>Williams is</i>
<i>in a very difficult place at the moment.</i>
Last year was pretty horrific.
<i>We just got it wrong.</i>
<i>We designed a bad race car.</i>
<i>And we've gotta fix it.</i>
[man] Jack. Okay?
-That was all of it.
-It's not your lunchbreak, as usual.
-Jeremy settle down.
-[Jeremy] No, it's not.
[Paddy] I actually found you
doing some work.
[Jeremy and man] Whoa!
[Jeremy] Straight in there, on Netflix.
[Paddy chuckles]
-[Jeremy] Thank you, Paddy.
-[Paddy chuckles]
[man] It's gonna be
Paddy's comedy special.
[Jeremy] Yeah.
My name is Paddy Lowe.
I'm Chief Technical Officer
for Rokit Williams Racing.
[Jeremy] There's no pressure
when Paddy is looking.
One of the biggest challenges is the one
that we face at the moment,
which is to take Williams back
to the front of the grid,
<i>where they have been in the past.</i>
We brought Paddy in from his
extraordinary successor, Mercedes.
<i>Trying to breathe new life into Williams.</i>
Rear is all ready to go.
-Pretty much.
-[man] Pretty close, yeah.
Paddy was the one who came up
with active suspension at Williams,
back in the 1980s.
He was the tech genius
<i>that was responsible for so much</i>
<i>of Williams' glory years.</i>
[Paddy] <i>Those days, a garage was quite</i>
<i>an oil-stained, concrete sort of place.</i>
<i>Now, very flash places with glossy floors</i>
<i>and sophisticated equipment.</i>
<i>So, a very, very different world.</i>
Thank you.
[Claire] <i>He's an incredibly clever</i>
<i>individual,</i>
<i>and he has really stripped</i>
<i>everything back to basics.</i>
[Paddy] <i>We made a lot of changes</i>
<i>to how we developed the car.</i>
Changes within the team,
changes within our technical approach.
So, we're optimistic that we've made
some good improvements.
[man] We are just connecting
the ERS pack up,
getting ready to fire up
the FW42 for the first time.
We're positive about this car,
but I was last year as well,
so hopefully, we've learnt.
[engineer] Okay.
[Paddy] <i>I wanna see a feeling</i>
<i>within the team...</i>
<i>that the team has turned a corner</i>
<i>and moved forwards...</i>
<i>and capable of winning championships</i>
<i>in the future.</i>
[drilling]
[drilling continues]
-[Paddy] So we get the year I hope.
-Yeah.
[George] So, should we do a race?
We'll do a quick corner.
I mean... I'm doing quite enough.
-[laughs]
-[Robert talking indistinctly]
Paddy simulation.
Oh, this is good.
It's not just back at base
that Williams are making changes.
They've got two brand new drivers
for 2019.
[Claire] Are you ready for the
professionals to come and kick your ass?
-[man] So, we having a race, are we?
-[Claire] Yes.
[Robert] We give you the advantage.
How many laps?
-[Claire] Shut up, "how many laps."
-[all laugh]
[Claire] "How many laps?"
-Do you know who pays your wages?
-[all laugh]
[Claire] Christ.
<i>Our driver lineup's wonderful this year.</i>
<i>I'm so happy.</i>
I was really clear around what we wanted.
I can't even see the car.
-It's right...
-Oh, yeah.
[Claire] <i>Robert and George</i>
<i>are two quite different personalities.</i>
<i>George is, I think,</i>
<i>a one-in-a-million driver.</i>
<i>He rarely puts a foot wrong.</i>
-Oh! [chuckles]
-Hey!
Man, come on.
-Who's the yellow one?
-That's me.
George Russell, hotly tipped,
Mercedes youngster,
Formula 2 champion. Really exciting guy.
[commentator] <i>He can see</i>
<i>the checkered flag. George Russell wins!</i>
[Claire] <i>He's fought his way up the ranks.</i>
Some pretty senior people in F1
who know what they're talking about,
there's a lot of talk that George
is a future world champion.
-Have you won?
-[Claire shrieks]
-George!
-[George] Sorry, Claire.
-[Claire] That's really unsportsmanlike.
-[George] I know. Right.
I'm George Russell.
I'm racing for Rokit Williams Racing.
<i>For me, it's a dream</i>
<i>to be part of Formula 1.</i>
I've lived my whole life
wanting to become an F1 driver.
Out of the hundreds and thousands
of people who've tried, I'm one of 20.
And that's... Yeah, that's incredible.
Oh, my God, my eyes are going weird.
-You're surprisingly not... [chuckles]
-Oh!
Something's gone wrong.
-Yes!
-[laughs]
-I'm surprisingly what? Not bad?
-You're surprisingly not... Oh! [laughs]
Can't believe you said that
I'm surprisingly not that bad.
Oh, no.
This is all we did at home
when we were growing up. Oh!
Robert's at pole. Robert's at pole.
[Claire] <i>I wanted Robert in the car,</i>
<i>'cause I wanted a driver that was able</i>
<i>to understand the issues with the car.</i>
<i>Robert had seriously impressed us</i>
<i>over the course of last year,</i>
<i>as our development driver.</i>
I'm Robert Kubica, I'm from Poland
and I'm racing for Rokit Williams Racing.
It is strange to be back in Formula 1
after more than eight years.
[Will] <i>Talk to anybody from go-kart</i>
<i>all the way up to Formula 1,</i>
Robert was one of, if not the best.
[crowd cheering]
Robert was the one they feared,
the one that they knew
could and would make it.
He was supposed to go to Ferrari
to join Fernando.
That was supposed to be the dream team.
My career, unfortunately,
changed quite drastically.
<i>In 2011, I suffered</i>
<i>a big accident in Italy.</i>
<i>I suffered a lot of injuries.</i>
The crash was so bad
that it nearly severed his right arm.
<i>The fact he can control a Formula 1 car</i>
<i>is incredible to all of us.</i>
<i>It's a huge thing for Robert to come back.</i>
<i>It is the Hollywood story.</i>
<i>It's one of the great sporting comebacks.</i>
To be back is a dream.
[Claire] <i>He's a bit like a dog</i>
<i>with a bone.</i>
<i>He will push and push and push</i>
<i>until we fix the issues with the car,</i>
<i>and he is not shy in telling us</i>
<i>what those issues are.</i>
-My finger's hurting.
-[man laughs]
They signify everything that
I've always wanted in a driver lineup.
Oh, yes. I'm still in the...
-Am I still in the lead?
-[man] You are.
[George] Oh, no! [chuckles]
[man] Claire wins!
-Did I win? Did I?
-[man] You win.
-Mentally, I'm destroyed now.
-[laughs]
That's better.
Everything is focused on getting your car
to that first day of testing.
[Claire] Would you...
There are a few bits of printing.
Would you mind just printing them for me?
It's a letter.
Thank you very much.
<i>This is car build week.</i>
Mike, I'm on my way down.
<i>It's gotta go on Saturday night,</i>
<i>and everything has gotta be on it.</i>
<i>Everything's gotta be ready.</i>
Doesn't that blue look nice?
-[man] Yeah.
-I can see...
-Have you seen your team kit yet?
-Yeah.
-[Claire] Do you like it?
-It's really nice, yeah.
[drilling]
[Claire] <i>People just think we have a car,</i>
<i>and it goes around the world</i>
<i>to every race.</i>
<i>A few guys change the tires on it,</i>
<i>and that's about it.</i>
You have to depressurize,
so they both can get through there.
So we can get this all the way down.
[Claire] <i>These cars</i>
<i>are extraordinarily complex.</i>
<i>There's 20,000 parts</i>
<i>that we're manufacturing ourselves.</i>
[man 1] How many of these have we got?
-One for the moment?
-[man 2] Yeah, we're not gonna scrap it.
[man 1] No, no, no.
[Claire] <i>When you are an independent team,</i>
<i>when you are a team</i>
<i>on a budget the size of ours,</i>
<i>it's an extraordinary challenge</i>
<i>to actually get your car to testing.</i>
[man 3] The rear end is on there,
and the rear end
is actually structurally complete.
The mirror idea is a real winner.
Haven't heard that word for a long time.
-[man 3] Yeah.
-Jesus.
-[man 3] And it's--
-[Claire] New wing mirrors.
They could be the reversal of our fortune.
-[man 3] Yeah.
-[Claire] Something so simple.
[man 3] We are a very, very long way
behind having a finished car here
before we go to the test.
Massive challenge at the moment
is the delivery of diffuser.
[Claire] What's the issue
with the diffuser?
-What's the holdup on that?
-[man 3] Um...
The complexity of the parts
are delaying the delivery.
And we've got a host
of components which
We've got an issue with
the front bell crank
pivot shafts are not finished.
The pin for the tower bracket
we've somewhat lost track of.
These are for bigger problems that...
We haven't even got any wheel nuts
to hold the wheels on.
Have we not worked it out yet?
-[man 4] We're still digging into it.
-[man 3] Still digging into it.
[woman] Meeting with Mike and Nicky.
Did you say tomorrow?
[Paddy] No.
I need to speak with them today.
-Okay.
-[cell phone rings]
Hello?
Yes, speaking.
<i>It's not all on schedule at the moment.</i>
Uh, we have had a number of slippages.
<i>There are 101 different issues</i>
<i>with the car that weren't expected.</i>
<i>They're all being dealt with,</i>
and, inevitably, that means that things
can take longer than was planned.
Re-machine the holes? Change the dials.
But we will get to the test.
<i>We always do.</i>
-[Claire] Everything's all right?
-[man 1] Yeah.
[Claire] Still smiling?
-Yeah.
-[man 2] Good.
[Claire] It's in better shape
than it did yesterday.
Yeah. It's just frustrating,
the little bits of rig parts.
[Claire] Yes. Yes, I know.
It will be an extraordinary feat
if we make this on Monday, right?
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Claire] Which we're gonna.
Yeah. We are.
-I'll leave you to it. We will.
-[man] I hope so. Yeah.
-See you later.
-[man] See you.
[indistinct chatter]
[Will] <i>There are only eight days</i>
<i>of pre-season testing...</i>
to put your car on track, figure out
what works, figure out what doesn't.
<i>To be as ready as your rivals</i>
<i>once you get to the first race</i>
<i>of the year.</i>
The big news really today is the fact
that Williams will not run today
and they won't run tomorrow, either.
<i>The car isn't ready yet.</i>
It was a huge shock.
<i>With only eight days</i>
<i>of pre-season testing,</i>
<i>every second on track counts.</i>
<i>Missing half a day,</i>
<i>missing an hour is huge.</i>
<i>You don't miss testing.</i>
[Claire] I'll take that one with me.
-[man 1] This one?
-Yeah.
-[man 1] And the other one?
-[man 2] This one's coming on this side.
They need to be very safeguarded.
-[man 2] I think I broke it.
-[Claire and man laughing]
-It's a million man-hours, right?
-[Claire] Yeah.
That is a lot of blood, sweat
and tears in there.
<i>Realizing the car isn't going to be ready</i>
<i>for winter testing brings out disbelief.</i>
<i>It was like, "Are you kidding?</i>
<i>How did this happen?</i>
<i>How did we get to this point?</i>
<i>How do we protect the damage</i>
<i>that this is going to do?"</i>
<i>I was... I was incredibly angry.</i>
Get these bits to the garage
'cause they need to start working on them.
They're gonna have their work
cut out this morning
getting all those bits on the car.
It would be so nice
to see it out on the track.
It's not been a good few days.
I'm hoping that when people
see it on track today,
everyone will have forgotten about it
and hopefully will bring us
a bit of performance.
And to have George and Robert,
it's really exciting.
I can't wait to see those guys
get in the car for the first time.
It'll be really nice.
[Will] <i>It's not unheard of for parts</i>
<i>to be flown out last minute,</i>
<i>but when team management</i>
<i>are flying out with them,</i>
<i>you get the impression</i>
<i>it's pretty drastic.</i>
[Claire] Here you go.
How you doing? You all right?
We've got your bits.
[Will] <i>At times like this, you can't look</i>
<i>to the boys on the factory floor.</i>
<i>They're doing as much as they can</i>
<i>with the equipment at their disposal.</i>
<i>It has to go higher.</i>
The ultimate question is
where does the buck stop?
<i>Does it stop with the person appointed</i>
<i>to head that technical direction</i>
<i>and the ultimate design of the car,</i>
<i>or does it fall to the person</i>
<i>who made that appointment?</i>
<i>Whose head's on the block?</i>
[Claire] Are you all right?
[Dave] Yeah.
It's just nice to see
the car in the garage.
Christ.
If we could've had it three weeks ago,
we'd be laughing.
Hi, Claire.
Hindsight, Dave, is a wonderful thing.
Hi, Paddy. You all right?
-How was your flight?
-Fine.
-[Paddy] Early?
-Yeah, it was early.
Got all the bits with you?
Got the bits. Yeah.
They're out at the back. Yeah.
[Claire sighs]
It happens
when you get out onto the grounds.
[Claire] Yeah.
All right, let's see those bits.
-Hi. You all right?
-[woman] Yeah. You?
-[Claire] Yeah.
-[woman] Good.
Yes. All good.
[reporter] But what has been
the reason of the delay?
We're not going to be discussing
those issues in public.
It's not ideal.
Um, this is not the situation
that we wanted to find ourselves in.
Particularly after last year.
We wanted to come out strongly.
<i>That's one of the hardest parts</i>
<i>of the job,</i>
<i>when you're feeling down and you feel</i>
<i>like you couldn't be kicked anymore.</i>
<i>I'm getting a kicking at the moment</i>
<i>from every angle.</i>
We're not just disappointed, but it's...
It's embarrassing not bringing
a race car to a circuit.
[Paddy] <i>I don't need anyone else</i>
<i>to give me a hard time.</i>
<i>I'm my worst judge, let's say.</i>
<i>The bottom line is</i>
<i>we didn't do the right things.</i>
<i>We have many difficulties at the moment.</i>
<i>Lots of challenges to face.</i>
<i>I suppose it's part of my makeup</i>
<i>to not reflect any sense of panic.</i>
<i>I'm an engineer,</i>
<i>so problems are objective.</i>
<i>They're not emotional things</i>
<i>because emotions don't get us anywhere.</i>
[engineer] You good?
-[George] Yeah. Ready for it.
-[engineer] Yeah?
Been ready for three days, mate.
[George] It feels like...
-This is how we normally do things.
-[George laughs]
We just leave it late.
Well, you can see there's a little bit
of a crowd around the Williams garage.
The good news for them is they have
finally got their car sorted out.
<i>So, Williams up and running,</i>
but a lot of questions being asked why
they initially missed the first two days.
[Paddy] Very large rank.
-[man 1] Sorry?
-Very large rank of media in here.
[man 1] Well, it's the only time
you've spoken in days.
[Claire] Yeah, we'll do that.
[Paddy] Work to do.
[man 2] Paddy, what happened?
Why was the car late?
Um, that is a very, very
complicated matter and I...
Frankly, I don't even know
the answer because it's...
It will take a lot of
investigation and analysis.
In general, the thing that
has got us out is the, uh...
The sheer quantity and complexity
of parts you have to produce
to make a Formula 1 car these days.
[Will] <i>I spoke to Paddy over testing</i>
<i>and he refused to take responsibility.</i>
<i>You're either responsible or you're not.</i>
<i>So, you gotta take it on the chin.</i>
And he kind of refused to do that, so...
[clicks tongue] See you later, Paddy.
[reporter] <i>There have been some</i>
<i>big developments at Williams.</i>
<i>With immediate effect, Paddy Lowe,</i>
<i>"has taken a leave of absence from</i>
<i>the business for personal reasons."</i>
[interviewer] Can we talk
about Paddy at all?
[Claire] <i>There's no point</i>
<i>wasting that energy,</i>
<i>focusing on something</i>
<i>that's been and done.</i>
<i>You gotta move forward.</i>
<i>Formula 1 moves fast.</i>
<i>We gotta start racing</i>
<i>and that's where it really matters.</i>
-Okay. Bye, girls.
-[Claire] Kisses. Can I get kisses?
-Bye.
-[Marc] See you later. See you later.
Girls, go inside before you get cold.
Have a nice breakfast.
-Bye, monkey.
-[Claire] Okay.
I've got butterflies in my stomach.
I always get them driving to Silverstone.
I wonder what George and Robert must
feel like going into this race weekend.
[Marc] I don't worry, necessarily.
I just worry that we can keep it.
That's really important to me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I'm fed up with drivers.
Buggering off, leaving us
to go somewhere else.
We nurture all this talent
and then they get to go off--
-They get their success somewhere else.
-Yeah.
I want to be the one
that gives a driver a good car.
<i>Formula 1 is not easy.</i>
<i>Sometimes, I think to myself,</i>
<i>"Christ, when is it gonna get easier</i>
<i>and what more do we have to do</i>
<i>to close that gap down to the midfield?"</i>
<i>We're here in this sport</i>
<i>because we love racing.</i>
<i>We do not love being</i>
<i>at the back of the pack.</i>
-Good morning!
-[George] Good morning.
Are you gonna get near
the podium this morning?
I will do my best,
but I can't promise anything.
-[woman 1] Of course he will.
-[George] Thank you.
-[woman 2] Good to see you.
-[man] Drive well.
Thank you. Likewise.
Nice to meet you.
Overall, it's not been ideal at all.
I mean, obviously, you dream of coming
into Formula 1 and winning races.
That's the dream.
[sighs] Morning.
Morning.
Just driving around on my own.
No one in front of me,
no one really behind me.
[man] Are you gonna race next year?
Can't tell you that.
Can't tell you that.
-Sorry, I have to go.
-Go.
-I'll see you later.
-[woman] Go.
[George] <i>Obviously, I want more.</i>
<i>I want to be a world champion.</i>
<i>I'd love to be in Lewis' shoes, you know.</i>
In a car, firstly, capable of winning
almost every single weekend,
and performing to a level
that he performs week in, week out.
<i>But I believe I'll get there one day.</i>
<i>I believe I'll have that opportunity.</i>
[reporter] Difficult to show
your potential
when you're always
at the back of the grid.
No, it's not difficult at all
because the people
who will make a difference in my career,
the top people at Williams,
the top people at Mercedes,
they know exactly how I'm performing,
even if the result isn't
exactly the same every week.
So, I have no concerns with that.
Cheers, thanks.
[Will] <i>George is on the Mercedes</i>
<i>young driver scheme,</i>
so that means he has, at least in part,
his future assured.
I'm late for something, guys.
Cheers. Thank you.
The air condition's calibrated so
that the most power goes in my room.
-That's why the race took their team off.
-[woman] That's probably true.
-It's not true.
-[woman chuckles] I know.
[Will] <i>Toto Wolff as head of Mercedes</i>
<i>has always been very impressed</i>
<i>and has always spoken</i>
<i>incredibly well of George.</i>
Whether that means George will make it
into the big Mercedes team?
Only time will tell.
But it's certainly on George's radar.
It's really nice to see
the Mercedes junior program
-has come back to life.
-Yeah.
And we're taking the most potential
young guys, and here we go.
Firstly, Mercedes are the number one team
in Formula 1 and have been for so long.
They were the guys
who invested in my junior career
and ultimately really helped me
to make the step into Formula 1.
[Toto] It's very rare that a rookie
wins the F2 season.
So, he won the F2 season,
-and now we have a problem.
-[man] I saw it last year.
[all chuckle]
-He's gonna be a future world champion.
-[man] I know.
That's what some of my colleagues...
-[Toto] They say that.
-[man] ...told me earlier this year...
-When you put me in your car, Toto.
-[Toto] Yeah.
That's the... [chuckles]
[Toto] That's the trick.
-Yeah.
-[laughs]
[announcer 1] <i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the historic Silverstone Circuit</i>
<i>for the British Grand Prix.</i>
[George] <i>I am a rookie.</i>
<i>I don't have experience,</i>
<i>but I'm deadly serious,</i>
<i>and when it's got anything to do</i>
<i>with making me go quicker,</i>
<i>I'm definitely incredibly serious.</i>
<i>I need to work my socks off</i>
<i>to justify why I'm in Formula 1.</i>
<i>And show my true colors</i>
<i>that I can be a team player</i>
<i>and really build this team</i>
<i>through the tough times.</i>
[Claire] <i>George very much encapsulates</i>
<i>a Williams spirit.</i>
<i>He's got that, you know,</i>
<i>"I'm gonna just get on with it."</i>
[announcer 2]
<i>Last car approaching the grid.</i>
[Claire] <i>I'm so pleased that he's joined</i>
<i>Williams at the start of his F1 career.</i>
<i>And all I hope and pray is</i>
<i>that he is with us for a long time.</i>
[engines revving]
[commentator] <i>Everybody cleanly through</i>
<i>the first corner at Abbey.</i>
<i>It's the Williams bringing up the rear.</i>
[George] It's all over the place.
<i>Understeer is atrocious.</i>
These brakes aren't improved.
We're gonna have to stop.
It's getting to the point of danger.
Struggling a lot.
Do we really need to leave me out here,
overtaken like this?
Hit me.
[Marc] Stay out. Stay out.
[George] <i>However. Come on.</i>
You don't wanna risk anything.
Car's all over the show.
[commentator] <i>Lewis Hamilton wins</i>
<i>the British Grand Prix for a sixth time.</i>
<i>What a performance from him.</i>
[George] <i>Still quite incredible for me</i>
<i>how you can finish a lap,</i>
<i>it feels like one of the best laps</i>
<i>you've ever done in your life.</i>
<i>Still, in the scheme of things,</i>
<i>incredibly fast, but these guys</i>
<i>have just got something more.</i>
We need to sort this out.
We really, really need to sort this out.
<i>In my previous years, I had one target,</i>
<i>and that was, you either put it on pole</i>
<i>or win the race.</i>
<i>I'm driving around in 19th position</i>
<i>week in, week out and...</i>
<i>I don't wanna be there.</i>
[Claire] <i>I'm sure he's frustrated</i>
<i>by some things</i>
<i>that we haven't been able</i>
<i>to action fast enough.</i>
<i>I wish for both of them that</i>
<i>we'd given them a better car this year.</i>
-It's pretty brutal out there.
-[George] Yeah. I know. Tell me about it.
[man] Frustrating, isn't it?
[Claire] <i>You've gotta take the small wins</i>
<i>to make yourself feel good every so often.</i>
<i>Okay. We beat Vettel.</i>
[laughs]
-Yeah. Exactly.
-[man] Yeah.
Yeah. We did.
You're not spraying champagne
each and every weekend.
<i>Only one team can do that.</i>
<i>Only one driver can do that.</i>
[George] It's just a joke at the moment.
I've never been
so inconsistent in my life.
You look at my lap chart,
you think I'm a bloody rookie or whatever.
I felt like I was driving very similar
lap after lap, and it was like a yo-yo.
I felt like an idiot.
We need to seriously pull our fingers out.
[man] Okay. All right.
We'll see what we can do about that.
Good job. Well done. Well done, thank you.
[Frank] No real point.
[Claire] No. We were only lapped once
which makes a change.
Yeah.
[indistinct chatter]
[Claire] <i>Certainly,</i>
<i>I feel enormous pressure</i>
<i>whether I'm good enough to do this job.</i>
<i>The pressure is there</i>
<i>because it is our family business</i>
<i>and I took this job on</i>
<i>for a very particular purpose,</i>
<i>and that was to protect a legacy.</i>
-Is that it?
-[interviewer 1] All good.
-Yeah?
-[interviewer 1] Yeah.
Okay.
You didn't ask the last question about,
"Has Williams got a future
or is Williams going to be in trouble?"
-[interviewer 2] I didn't?
-No. [chuckles]
[interviewer 1] She didn't...
I was thinking when I read it, I was like,
"I am not answering that question."
And then I was thinking about it
and I said,
-"Maybe I should answer that question."
-[interviewer 2] Do you wanna answer it?
-You can.
-Yeah.
[interviewer 2] I was told you didn't want
to hear it because you shouldn't.
-I don't wanna...
-[Claire] No.
[interviewer 2] Make you answer
something you don't wanna answer.
You can ask me. Ask me the question.
[interviewer 2] So, is there a danger
that if this goes on,
-it could be the end of Williams for you?
-[Claire] Yeah. Okay.
Williams isn't on its way out
just 'cause it's had a few...
A couple of bad years.
We're fighters,
at the end of the day, at Williams.
That was what we do.
We will fight
whether we're winning the championship
or we'll fight
if we're losing the championship,
and we will continue
to fight in this sport
for many, many years to come.
You're Netflix?
Not anymore. Fuck you, Netflix.
[crowd cheering]
[man 1] This is where
I'll have my single life.
This is the no-go zone.
[man 2] What do you think you did better
than Pierre Gasly to grab his seat?
[chuckles]
[man 3] <i>What the hell is he doing?</i>
If I get knocked,
I try to knock even harder.
[man 4] Very hard
to keep up with that man.
-[yells indistinctly]
-[screaming]
[man 5] This is the best day of my life.[panting]
It's all about mental strength.
Pierre... his year got off
to a horrible start.
<i>You could just see this driver</i>
<i>in front of you wilting.</i>
[Gasly grunts]
[Christian Horner] <i>Can't keep making</i>
<i>excuses for him.</i>
<i>It's not good for us as a team.</i>
<i>We're just running one leg in...</i>
<i>If you can't deal with that pressure,</i>
<i>is it time to change?</i>
[Gasly] <i>There is unfinished business</i>
<i>with Red Bull.</i>
[interviewer] I mean,
how do you feel about it?
About the change?
[interviewer] Yeah.
Well, for sure, for me
at the beginning I was surprised
'cause, uh, it's not what they told me.
We're in a unique position in Formula 1
where we have four cockpits.
We've got four cockpits,
we can move the drivers around.
<i>They're all Red Bull drivers.</i>
<i>Toro Rosso drivers are</i>
<i>Red Bull contracted drivers.</i>
[Gasly] <i>The change, the swap,</i>
<i>coming back in Toro Rosso,</i>
I was disappointed, 'cause for me,
I didn't feel like that was really fair.
You are just, like...
You're angry.
[photographer] Action!
[Franz Tost] <i>Was not so confident</i>
<i>with the Red Bull car.</i>
And, uh, that stand to reason
why he struggled.
Then the confidence goes down,
uh, you feel, as a driver, that the team
doesn't believe, anymore, so much in you.
-[in Italian] Good morning.
-Good morning.
[Tost in English] <i>Therefore, it was good</i>
<i>that he came back to us.</i>
Morning!
-Morning.
-Morning.
[Tost] How is everything?
[man] Very well, thank you, yourself?
[photographer] Action.
[Gasly] <i>My goal as a Red Bull driver</i>
<i>will always be</i>
<i>to be in the top team</i>
<i>in that Red Bull car.</i>
You know, you feel the need,
"I need to get there, I need to do it."
<i>Uh, we'll do what it needs</i>
<i>to get back there.</i>
It felt, "Okay, what have we got to lose
by switching these two drivers
to evaluate them to the end of the year?"
[tools drilling]
[David Croft] <i>Here comes Alex Albon now,</i>
<i>round the outside.</i>
[Martin Brundle] <i>That's bold if he's gonna</i>
<i>go past Ricciardo there.</i>
[Croft] <i>What a move!</i>
<i>The rookie, Alex Albon,</i>
<i>passes the McLaren!</i>
[cheering]
[Horner] <i>Alex is exceeding</i>
<i>all our expectations.</i>
<i>You know, we're seeing him</i>
<i>fighting for a podium.</i>
This has been a monumental step for him.
You have to remember, this is
his first year in Formula 1 racing.
[Sofie Albon] You need, like, pajamas.
-[Minki Medina] Yeah.
-[Sofie] You need, like, shampoo.
-I've taken them already.
-And conditioner.
-Bodywash.
-I did. Done that.
Did you get me a shirt?
-[Sofie] Deodorant.
-[Minki] Put some more clothes.
[Alexander Albon] <i>Being an Aston Martin</i>
<i>Red Bull Racing driver,</i>
<i>it's a crazy thing to think about.</i>
Actually, when I think about it now,
it still doesn't feel believable.
Bye.
[Albon] <i>Everything's happening so fast.</i>
<i>I'm, like, not living</i>
<i>with my parents anymore.</i>
Beautiful.
[chuckles] I've got no one to do
my laundry, which I'm very sad about.
Plus, I'm moving to Monaco, so...
<i>I'm going full F1 driver spec,</i>
<i>living the life.</i>
<i>This is my place.</i>
Obviously got an amazing view.
This is where
I'm gonna have my single life.
[Minki] But now, we have to unpack.
It's a big, you know, like a big step,
moving away from home.
[Albon] <i>I realize that I have been</i>
<i>fast-tracked into a big team.</i>
I've done well, but there's
nothing really to say that...
I fully deserve the seat.
<i>You know it could always be</i>
<i>your last opportunity. </i>
<i>This is your chance to show yourself.</i>
They want to see that sign that,
you know, they want you for next year,
and that's what I'm working towards.
<i>I've got to show that I belong here.</i>
[man 1 speaking Spanish]
<i>Welcome to Brazil.</i>
<i>This is Interlagos.</i>
<i>The circuit is between the lakes.</i>
[man 2 speaking indistinct language]
[reporter 1] <i>Alex,</i>
<i>a very happy week for you</i>
<i>because you have been confirmed</i>
<i>as a Red Bull Racing driver for 2020.</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>
[Albon] <i>Thank you very much.</i>
So, I've just been announced
that I'm a Red Bull driver for 2020.
<i>Yeah. Very cool.</i>
How do you find out
that you've got the Red Bull seat?
Does it come in an email,
in a phone call?
An email.
-A Post-it Note.
-[laughs]
-On your desk?
-[laughs] Yeah.
I'm... I'm happy. I'm very happy.
[reporter 2] Alex, what did you think
that you did better than Pierre Gasly
to have his seat?
[chuckles] You ask
a very tough question. Um...
<i>Now I've been announced,</i>
<i>it feels really good.</i>
<i>It feels really, really good.</i>
-We are running late.
-[Albon] Why?
-Because you're a chatterbox. That's why.
-[Albon] Let's--
Speaking for England today.
Always, mate, always.
And talking for Thailand.
Hello. Sorry we're late.
-Hi, Alex!
-Hey. How are you?
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
[Gasly] <i>This is so frustrating.</i>
<i>The fact that it's a dream</i>
<i>and the beginning...</i>
And you work so hard every day,
and people helping you,
your family, making big sacrifices
to give you the chance,
one day, maybe, to live your dream.
<i>When you go through these challenges,</i>
<i>you take, like, big hits.</i>
<i>Uh, need to get back up</i>
<i>and just prove my point. </i>
I'm the kind of guy that if I get knocked,
I just go back at it
and try to knock even harder.
[machine whirring]
Everything okay?
All good.
[Tost] <i>Every driver in Formula 1</i>
<i>has something to prove, </i>
<i>especially after the first half</i>
<i>of the season</i>
<i>when he was struggling at Red Bull Racing.</i>
<i>He has to prove that this was a period</i>
<i>where he learned a lot. </i>
Such emotional periods
are so, so important in any kind of sport.
[man 1] Carlos!
[man 2] Carlos! Carlos!
[Zak Brown] <i>This year, Carlos has been</i>
<i>very competitive.</i>
<i>We've all been impressed. </i>
We knew he was very fast,
and I think he's proven that.
[talking indistinctly]
[groans]
[scatting]
I've done a good job
the whole season, really.
I was performing at a high level.
-[Tom Stallard] <i>All right, P5!</i>
-[Sainz] Ay-ay-ay!
Whoo! It's really good.
[Tom Stallard] <i>Flawless.</i>
<i>Great work, Carlos.</i>
[Croft] <i>Carlos Sainz finishes</i>
<i>in fifth place in the McLaren!</i>
[all cheering]
[Croft] <i>And that equals</i>
<i>his best-ever finish...</i>
[man] What's this?
A double shot.
<i>It's probably been</i>
<i>my strongest year in F1.</i>
<i>So it makes me feel proud</i>
<i>and happy about this season.</i>
Morning, Zak.
[Brown] Mornin', how are you?
[Sainz] Good, you?
[Brown] Other than my back's wrenched...
[Sainz] Your back?
Yeah, everyone's been telling me
to work out and lose weight.
I'm working out to lose weight,
I hurt my back.
I'm gonna be as fit as you soon.
-Maybe not.
-Mmm...
[Brown laughs]
This time last year,
we were one of the slowest cars,
and at some events, the slowest car.
<i>This year, it's been</i>
<i>a very successful season,</i>
<i>but still a long way to go</i>
<i>as we look to get back to the front.</i>
[Will Buxton] <i>McLaren,</i>
<i>there's every chance</i>
<i>that if they continue this trend, </i>
they could be competing
with the likes of Red Bull,
possibly Ferrari and Mercedes for podiums.
<i>It's great to see.</i>
<i>They're one of the great teams</i>
<i>of Formula 1 history </i>
<i>with a spring in their step.</i>
[Sainz] <i>For me, I want to prove to McLaren</i>
<i>that they have chosen the right guy.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome to the penultimate</i>
<i>Grand Prix of 2019. We're in Brazil.</i>
[Horner] <i>To drive for Red Bull,</i>
<i>the expectations on him,</i>
<i>it's high pressure.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>It's now down to Alex Albon</i>
<i>to deliver week-in, week-out.</i>
[Albon] <i>Being with the top team,</i>
<i>there is that realization</i>
<i>that you are in a winning car.</i>
<i>There's always going to be that sense that</i>
<i>you want to be delivering good results.</i>
<i>The guys have put their faith in me.</i>
Yeah, just get ready.
[Pierre Hamelin] <i>And radio check, Alex.</i>
[Albon] Yep, radio check.
[Mattia Spini] <i>Okay, Pierre,</i>
<i>need to be more strict from the start.</i>
[Gasly] Yeah.
[Croft] <i>Carlos Sainz starts in the back</i>
<i>of the grid after trouble in qualifying.</i>
<i>McLaren's five-year wait for a podium</i>
<i>looks set to continue.</i>
[engines revving]
[Croft] <i>And we're racing in Brazil!</i>
<i>Alex Albon and Pierre Gasly,</i>
<i>wheel-to-wheel!</i>
<i>And Albon gets past him.</i>
[Gasly] Fuckin' hell!
[Hamelin] <i>That was good positioning.</i>
<i>Good job, Alex.</i>
[Croft] <i>Sainz's running last</i>
<i>after the problems in qualifying.</i>
[Sainz] How's my pace?
[Stallard] <i>Pace looks good, Carlos.</i>
[in Spanish] Come on!
Come on!
[Stallard in English] <i>Yes, Carlos.</i>
<i>Great start, mate, great start.</i>
[Hamelin] <i>Doing great, Alex, we are P4.</i>
[Brundle] <i>Alex Albon all over the back</i>
<i>of Sebastian Vettel!</i>
[Hamelin] <i>He's overtaking them.</i>
[Croft] <i>Albon is going right</i>
<i>at Sebastian Vettel!</i>
[Brundle] <i>He's done it!</i>
[all cheering]
[Croft] <i>The youngster</i>
<i>in his rookie season,</i>
<i>never been on the podium before, </i>
<i>finds himself in third place</i>
<i>at the moment!</i>
[Stallard] <i>That's your target, Carlos,</i>
<i>we need to beat him.</i>
[Sainz] Copy.
[Brundle] <i>Carlos Sainz is up to tenth</i>
<i>from the back of the grid. </i>
<i>Really excellent performance.</i>
[Riccardo Musconi]
<i>Let's take care of the car.</i>
<i>Cool the car a bit.</i>
[Croft] <i>There's smoke</i>
<i>coming out of the back</i>
<i>of Valtteri Bottas' Mercedes engine.</i>
[Valtteri Bottas] Lost the power.
[Croft] <i>Valtteri Bottas,</i>
<i>engine overheating.</i>
<i>And it's going to be a terminal problem.</i>
[Sainz] The Haas,
driving super erratically.
[Stallard] <i>Copy.</i>
[Croft] <i>They make contact!</i>
<i>Sainz now up into sixth and on the tail</i>
<i>of Ricciardo for fifth.</i>
<i>Nice move from Pierre Gasly.</i>
[Spini] <i>You're doing a good job, Pierre.</i>
<i>Keep going.</i>
[man speaks indistinctly]
[Croft] <i>Once again, Ferrari on Ferrari,</i>
<i>battling each other!</i>
[Brundle] <i>And Leclerc goes for it,</i>
<i>very late!</i>
<i>Vettel, trying to get back past. </i>
[Leclerc] What the hell?
[Brundle] <i>And this is</i>
<i>totally self-inflicted by Ferrari.</i>
<i>It's both of them! Both cars out!</i>
[Sebastian Vettel in German]
My God, must this happen?
[Vettel in English]
What the hell is he doing?
<i>Try to come in slowly. Slowly.</i>
[Vettel] That's it. I'll drive.
[Brundle] <i>That's definitely not gonna</i>
<i>improve relationships down at Ferrari.</i>
[Mattia Binotto]
<i>Something happening like that,</i>
<i>it's hard for the entire team.</i>
I think we are all very sad
because that's the type of weekend
you would like to forget.
[Croft] <i>The safety car's been deployed</i>
<i>as there's debris on track.</i>
[Hamelin] <i>Both Ferraris are out.</i>
[Albon] Yes.
[Hamelin] <i>Keep going, Alex,</i>
<i>you're doing a great job.</i>
[Croft] <i>It's the two Red Bulls leading,</i>
<i>Max Verstappen, then Alex Albon.</i>
<i>This could be Albon's</i>
<i>first-ever podium finish.</i>
[Hamelin] <i>Keep going, Alex.</i>
<i>Car behind is Gasly.</i>
[Spini] <i>Okay, Pierre, currently P3.</i>
<i>Hamilton behind us.</i>
[Lewis Hamilton] There's a car
ahead of me that's racing.
[Peter Bonnington] <i>That's Gasly.</i>
[Croft] <i>Carlos Sainz is in fifth place,</i>
<i>behind Lewis Hamilton.</i>
-[Hamilton] Safety car in.
-[Bonnington] <i>Okay. Copy this.</i>
[Hamilton] You can't overtake,
so keep it to lane, right?
[Brundle] <i>So, restarts.</i>
<i>Three laps here of absolute pandemonium!</i>
<i>The green flags are there.</i>
<i>It's Verstappen out in front</i>
<i>and pulling away!</i>
[Croft] <i>Hamilton is trying</i>
<i>to get past Gasly!</i>
<i>He's got him!</i>
<i>Albon locks up.</i>
<i>He's the next target for Hamilton!</i>
[Hamelin] <i>Alex, hold Hamilton up.</i>
<i>Keep your position.</i>
[Albon] Fuck!
[all exclaim]
[Croft] <i>Albon's been hit!</i>
<i>The chance of his first podium, gone!</i>
[crew member grunts] Fuck!
[Albon] Oh, no! No! No! No! [groans]
[Hamilton] Hey, guys. Sorry about that.
[Bonnington] <i>Continue. Continue.</i>
[Croft] <i>I reckon the stewards are gonna be</i>
<i>taking a look at that incident.</i>
<i>Hamilton may take a penalty for that.</i>
[Brundle] <i>Max Verstappen comes into the</i>
<i>final corner of the Brazilian Grand Prix.</i>
<i>The checkered flag is out!</i>
[Max Verstappen] Yes! Come on!
[Croft] <i>The Brazilian Grand Prix</i>
<i>goes to Max Verstappen!</i>
[all cheering]
[Croft] <i>Gasly is currently second.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton runs third.</i>
[Spini] <i>We have Hamilton behind.</i>
<i>We know the target now.</i>
<i>Keep pushing.</i>
[Hamilton] It's very hard
to keep up with him, man.
[Spini] <i>Keep pushing. Keep pushing.</i>
[Hamilton] Can't close this gap.
[Croft] <i>Gasly comes home</i>
<i>to take second place!</i>
[Gasly] Yeah!
[whooping]
[all cheering]
[Gasly speaking indistinctly]
[Croft] <i>And that is his first podium</i>
<i>in Formula 1.</i>
-[Spini] <i>Unbelievable!</i>
-[Gasly laughs] Incredible!
[Croft] <i>Hamilton comes home third!</i>
<i>Carlos Sainz equals his best performance</i>
<i>in a race by finishing fourth!</i>
-[Stallard] <i>Yes!</i>
-[Sainz exclaims]
[Stallard] <i>Great job, mate! P4.</i>
<i>Who thought it? P4.</i>
[speaking Spanish]
I can't believe it, man! Wow!
[chuckles] Can't believe it, guys.
[Stallard] <i>Unbelievable drive. P20 to P4.</i>
[Sainz] I cannot believe it. What a drive.
Thank you, guys.
Amazing. Amazing.
Yeah! Yeah!
[crowd cheering]
[all yelling indistinctly]
[Gasly] <i>Thank God.</i>
<i>This is the best day of my life.</i>
<i>Guys, thank you!</i>
<i>Thank you so much!</i>
[crew member] <i>Amazing!</i>
[Gasly] <i>You're amazing!</i>
<i>You guys are amazing!</i>
`[cheering intensifies]
It's, uh, the best moment in my life,
'cause it's something you dream
when you're a kid and...
you imagine being in Formula 1,
you imagine being on a Formula...
Like, a podium in Formula 1.
<i>These kind of moments,</i>
<i>that's why you love the sport.</i>
He had a tough start to the season
with Red bull and Toro Rosso.
I think he found himself again
and he was straight away quick.
He was feeling confident to come away
with the second place.
<i>That was, of course, yeah, amazing.</i>
[crowd chanting] Gasly! Gasly!
Gasly! Gasly! Gasly!
[Gasly] <i>Like, just...</i>
<i>so many things happened this year.</i>
It's been, like, such a roller coaster.
[commentator]
<i>Oh, that's a horrible accident!</i>
[Gasly] <i>You know, like, all the stuff</i>
<i>that happened within ten months,</i>
<i>probably one of the saddest moments</i>
<i>in my life, when Anthoine passed away.</i>
<i>First thing... I passed the line</i>
<i>and I thought about Anthoine</i>
<i>because, of course,</i>
<i>you think about these things.</i>
Losing a friend,
that's also what makes you as a...
makes you as a person.
All these experiences
you go through, and...
<i>it is important for me to show</i>
<i>my strength, and mental strength,</i>
that I can go through this
and get the job done.
[all cheering]
[laughs]
[Gasly] <i>I'm super excited about next year.</i>
I want a podium
every weekend, but... [laughs]
[all shout]
[Horner] My mate! Mate, mate, mate!
Don't be too hard on yourself.
[man over speaker]
<i>And the Toro Rosso as well,</i>
<i>to see, you know...</i>
[Croft] <i>We're just hearing that</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton could be getting a penalty</i>
<i>for his shunt with Alex Albon.</i>
Um, I massively apologize, Albon.
I went for a move, and...
completely my fault.
[Croft] <i>Which means, potentially,</i>
<i>Carlos Sainz could be</i>
<i>promoted into third place.</i>
[Caco] You fought from P20, mate.
-[Sainz] Yeah.
-[Caco] Fucking P20.
-[man] That's enormous.
-[Sainz] I need to know.
I'm, like, in the most awkward moment
of my career.
[man] Of course.
Like, I really, seriously don't have
a clue how to act right now.
Like... just wait.
We're waiting for the final justification
to come out from the FIA,
which will confirm P3.
But we don't know.
[in Spanish] And we are here waiting
to find out if Carlos is getting
his first podium.
[exhales]
-[man in English] I think we should.
-We'll do a team photo, for sure.
-Why?
-We shouldn't go on the podium.
[Caco] Are you telling me
we're not going on the podium?
Why?
Because I just don't want us
to look really desperate.
It's not desperate.
It's a legitimate podium.
First podium of his career
and he's going to look desperate?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Since the day he was born he's been
waiting for this fucking moment.
Are you fucking kidding me, "desperate"?
What the hell? What is wrong with her?
What is wrong with her?
There'll be celebrations
if this happens, won't there?
-Is it confirmed?
-[crew member] Yeah, it's confirmed.
[all cheering]
[Caco] Yes!
[Buxton] <i>Hamilton fighting with Alex Albon</i>
<i>for the podium places,</i>
<i>and ultimately, after the race,</i>
<i>was given a penalty.</i>
<i>So, Carlos Sainz</i>
<i>inherited that third place.</i>
His debut Formula 1 podium.
[all cheering]
<i>After the race, as the lights were going</i>
<i>down and the circuit was being packed up,</i>
<i>he went to the podium.</i>
I think the most unique podium celebration
that anyone's ever had
for their first Formula 1 podium,
because he didn't get to share it
with the two other drivers.
Got to share it with his entire team.
Yeah!
[shouting indistinctly]
They deserve the podium, so...
almost doesn't matter how you get it.
Just the fact that you got
a trophy to bring home
to all the men and women at McLaren
that have been through a lot,
and are working so hard for the team.
It was great to bring home
a trophy for 'em.
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>
-[crew member 1] Three, two, one!
-[crew member 2] Carlos!
[all cheer]
[interviewer] How do you feel
about the season?
Terrible. I wanna quit.
I'm kidding. Please don't play that.
[crowd cheering]
This is Daniel.
It's not. Who would... That's childish.
Are you on Netflix this year?
I don't know. I think they ignored me
for the whole year, so...
-they can fuck off.
-[both laugh]
[Croft] <i>It's the last race of the season</i>
<i>and time for the annual photo call.</i>
[photographer] Okay, guys.
Everybody looking to this camera, please.
Of course I'm kind of sad
to leave the team,
<i>but I'm grateful for the time that we had.</i>
<i>Really enjoyed my ride with them</i>
<i>for the three years we had together.</i>
<i>I'll always look back</i>
<i>and remember those times.</i>
<i>Keep them in good memories. </i>
All right, guys.
I think everybody knows where we are.
We are not where
we wanted to be this year.
I want to take this time
to actually thank you
and tell you, next year will be...
It must be better.
<i>My confidence in the team is still high.</i>
And hopefully just forget about 2019.
It never happened.
[Kevin Magnussen] It's tough to have
a whole year, like, almost written off,
but I think it will...
It'll kind of benefit us in the future,
all the things we've learned this year.
I think we have not to focus
on being the fastest,
but learning as much as possible.
-And then the fast comes on its own.
-[Romain Grosjean] Look at Mercedes.
-What they did was very impressive.
-Yeah.
They were very slow.
Then they got better,
then they got to Melbourne
and they put everything together.
Yeah. Exactly, yeah.
Yeah, but they're five times
world champions. We're not.
-[Romain Grosjean] Six.
-Six, sorry.
[laughs]
[Croft] <i>The magic number is six!</i>
<i>It's Lewis Hamilton!</i>
<i>Champion of the world!</i>
[Bonnington] <i>Get in there, Lewis.</i>
[Hamilton] I can't believe it!
I really can't believe it!
[Bonnington] <i>You did that in style.</i>
[Croft] <i>They are six-time</i>
<i>double world champions.</i>
After taking this photo,
'cause we're on a pretty tight schedule...
When the confetti cannon
goes off, when that photo's done,
we'll then need to leg it back in here.
-'Cause we're gonna have lunch in here.
-Yeah.
Otherwise, we'll end up mobbed
for half an hour, which, um...
There's a lot of people out there.
There's a lot of people,
so we're last in and we're first out.
We're coming back this way...
for some nosh.
[Hamilton] Should we not
make our way over?
I wanna go and take pictures of everyone.
[man 1] Here we go.
That's the... Yeah.
[woman] Shit!
[man 2] So, no going through the door.
[Hamilton] Damn,
this door is so... [laughs]
[man 1] World champion trapped in door.
[Hamilton] Dangerous doors.
[man 1] Health and Safety executive
would have a field day with that,
wouldn't they?
They'd want to interview you
a hundred times.
Well, I think you got
good insurance, though.
-So I guess I'd just claim.
-[laughing]
[groans] My... My back! My neck!
[man 1] My back! Yeah.
Millions!
Got a new engine stand this year as well.
-Congratulations.
-[Hamilton] Thank you.
-Congratulations. Very well done.
-[Hamilton] Thank you.
-And to you.
-Thanks a lot.
[Hamilton] No, thank you.
This is so awesome to see all this.
<i>As a kid, I always knew that I'd do</i>
<i>something great, something extraordinary.</i>
<i>But this has been the hardest year.</i>
<i>The team effort is just... it's humongous.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[man 3 over megaphone]
Come on, give him a wave, guys!
[Hamilton] <i>I just feel really grateful</i>
<i>for the opportunity</i>
<i>to be able to work with great people</i>
<i>and win these world titles.</i>
But I look at it and I'm really
just a chink in the chain
of a massive chain
of over a thousand people.
And I'm really kind of
the catalyst at the end.
<i>So, I just feel really grateful</i>
<i>in that respect.</i>
[man 3 speaking indistinctly
over megaphone]
Cheers to the camera!
One, two, three, four, five...
-Six!
-[all cheer]
[crowd applauding]
2020 is set to become one of
the biggest years in Formula 1's history.
Obviously, it's not a very level
playing field at the moment.
The sport has got out of control.
I want to be competitive once in a while.
New set of financial regulations.
So that the big teams
don't have such a big advantage.
Bringing the big spenders
a little bit closer to us.
We need to be ready for that.
[scoffs] Yeah.
They will, I believe,
make a huge difference.
You also have a pretty unique
scenario in 2020.
The majority of the drivers will be
out of contract at the end of the season.
We always wanna be better.
I don't feel too stressed about it.
[groans]
If you ask what it means to win
with Ferrari, I don't know. Because, um...
But I wanna find out.
The political permutations,
the back-door dealings...
You gotta make the most
of your opportunities when you can.
Arm wrestling that goes on
behind the scenes.
The peacock strutting.
It's about, "Push myself against
the best, I wanna be the best."
You're always under pressure.
Diamonds are made under pressure.
I want to be in the fastest car.
Hi!
Make sure that we are that dominant car.
Push Lewis Hamilton all the fucking way.
That's the hardest thing to do.
-It's not going to be easy.
-No.
It's more like a hobby for me.
So, obviously, I don't need
to do it if I don't want.
What are we doing this for?
[laughs]
Next year's gonna be a fun year.
Now we have a new chapter.
We're ready to take it on.[man] Bit higher.
[Horner] Took to season 3 to get a board.
Professional. We haven't done that before.
-[producer] Roll cameras.
-Oh shit, that's bright.
-Can I say it in Spanish?
-[producer] Yeah!
Do I look athletic?
Dynamic? Intelligent?
[chuckles]
Never held one of these things before.
Only see it in the movies.
<i>Drive to Survive: Season Three,</i>

{\an8}[Max] <i>Yes, boys, come on!</i>
{\an8}-[commentator] <i>Big accident.</i>
-[Leclerc] Fuck!
[Horner] If they're good enough,

If they're not good enough…

[in German] Fuck! How is this possible?
[Toto] A tough day at the office?
No, it was a total crap,
shit, awful day at the office.
-[woman] Looks dangerous.
-[Kevin] Looks angry.
This is the worst experience
I've had in any race car.
[Steiner] Last year,
this is roller coaster.
[commentator] <i>There's contact!</i>
[Steiner] We've got two fucking idiots
driving for us. This is not acceptable.
We will make changes.
Hope you get it fixed.
You tell me.
-[photographer] Nice. Big smiles.
-[Geri] Who's your favorite driver?
[Horner] Uh…
Whoever's winning for us.
[commentator] <i>Oh!</i>
<i>-Gasly makes a mistake.</i>
-[Gasly] Fuck, no!
[Horner] We've decided to release Pierre.
We're gonna remove that subject
and put you in place.
[Albon] I fully deserved the seat.
[man] The new driver lineup for McLaren.
[Sainz] For me, a new year is a new start.
Where's the fucking boot?
I'm working
more than anyone else in Formula 1.
It will show itself on track.
<i>-Vamos!</i>
-Waa!
-[Tom] Yes!
-[Sainz] Wow!
[Zak] I could see him being with McLaren
for quite some time.
Send it!
[Daniel] Last year,
I took a gamble and switched teams.
I feel a real responsibility
to push this car.
Let's fucking have it, boys.
[commentator] <i>A massive engine problem</i>

<i>Once again, Ferrari on Ferrari.</i>
[Leclerc] What the hell?
[commentator]
<i>It's both of them! Both cars out.</i>
[Vettel] Competing against the best,

Hell yeah, let's do it!
Ooh… Spicy.

[Daniel] Mate, that pink suit photo
is terrible, bro.

How does that one pass?
Mate, look at my face.
[man] What is that?
Can you scroll down?
It looks like he's taking a shit.
Show your eyes!
[giggling]
[Daniel] It's always hard
looking at yourself.
-[man] Especially wearing a pink suit.
-[Daniel] Yeah.
[man chuckles]
I don't really give a shit.
I know what I look like, but…
[cell phone rings]
[Daniel] Hi.
{\an8}[Grace] <i>So how's it going</i>?
{\an8}Good. We're just on our way to the track.
<i>With your traveling, you have been</i>

Go away.
Everyone to the bridge.
All of you guys get down there, please.
Thank you.
Hey, guys.
All right, guys, find your marks.
You'll see 'em written there. Find your
marks and stand next to your teammates.
Lauren is gonna do a couple of pullbacks
between the center of all you guys.
So what we want you guys to do
in this moment
is really picture your goals for this year
and what you're attempting to accomplish.
Picture them and visualize them,
so when this comes across,
they see you all genuinely really caring
about what we're talking about, okay?
Is everybody ready? And action!
[Buxton] Pre-season testing
is the first opportunity
{\an8}to get the 20 greatest drivers
in the world on track
{\an8}before the season begins.
[director] Everyone, reset your look.
Look back at camera, please.
Right at camera. Look tough.
Amazing. Thank you.
[Buxton] You can really sense the start
of the new season is almost upon us.
All right, everybody start walking.
Start walking!
Come. Come. Start walking.
[Buxton] And that means new drama,
new conflict and new possibilities.
[director] And killed it.
You guys are good.
Thank you, guys. You can go.
-Thank you, everybody!
-[Sainz] Thank you.
-All right, man. Have fun.

<i>The teams, the cars, the drivers,</i>

{\an8}[Horner] There's always an excitement
and anticipation<i> </i>about the testing.
Because it's, it's everything
starting to come to life.
{\an8}[Steiner] The hype is there.
The past, the hope.
{\an8}With a new season, what comes with it,
it's just this fantastic feeling.
{\an8}[Cyril] It's where
you have the first proper test.
{\an8}Against competitors,
but also against yourselves.
[machinery whirs]
[Toto] There is a buzz.
There's always a buzz,
and everybody's happy to come back.
Keen to see the performance
of the various teams and drivers.
{\an8}But you never…
You never kind of know what to expect.
[photographers call out]
{\an8}[Gow] This year, there's a genuine sense
up and down the pit lane
{\an8}that this season
might not be business as usual.
[Buxton] The team that everyone's talking
about this year is Racing Point.
And their billionaire owner,
Lawrence Stroll.
There's a lot of intrigue
as to exactly what's been going on
behind their garage doors over the winter.
[dramatic music playing]
[suspenseful music playing]
[Lawrence] All right.
You're gonna walk me through
what we're proposing for this season.
[Gow] Lawrence Stroll,
he has stature, he has a presence
that really commands your attention.
[Lawrence] Fifteen minutes
for the whole thing.
{\an8}Lawrence is a, uh, force of nature.
You know, I've worked previously
with owners that were billionaires,
but they didn't have the goals
that Lawrence has.
[Simon] Hi, Lawrence.
He brings funding,
but, uh, he also brings, uh, expectations.
[Lawrence] You got me till 12:30.
Fire away.
[Otmar] Uh…
I thought we would start with, uh, Simon
to present where we are
and, uh, where we will soon be.
[Lawrence] Thank you.
[clears throat, clicks tongue]
[Simon] So we, uh, the latest direction
is we've commenced an eight-week period
now of intense engineering.
There are two major areas that we're
looking at, and that remains on target.
We're trying to get that ready
for the end of the year.
So we're now
really going to drill into that,
and we'll be able to come back to you,
Lawrence, with some news.
[Lawrence] Sure.
My name is Lawrence Stroll.
I am the chairman.
At the end of 2018, Force India
was at the height of its financial crisis.
[reporter] <i>The Force India Formula 1 team</i>
<i>has gone into administration.</i>
<i>The team has survived</i>
<i>with a consortium of investors.</i>
<i>The consortium is led</i>
<i>by billionaire businessman,</i>
<i>Lawrence Stroll.</i>
[machinery whirs]
[Lawrence] There were a lot of people
who were very concerned
whether they'd have a job,
how their children would go to school
or their mortgages
or doctor bills were gonna be paid.
We acquired a team
that was fourth on the grid,
with a considerably smaller budget
than our competitors.
I really thought
this is a tremendous opportunity
in something
that I had a lot of passion for.
So our targets remain
business strategy, contract cost,
uh, and planned development.
[Lawrence] We have, um, very exciting
and ambitious growth plans,
and I believe
we can go from strength to strength.
-And that will bring lap time?
-[Simon] It will.
I've always won in the businesses
I've run. I plan on winning here.
-[chuckles] Thank you.
-[Simon] Thanks.
-We're done?
-[Otmar] Yeah, we're done.
Lawrence is a big character
who made an instant impact
the second that he first entered
a Formula 1 paddock.
He's serious.
And he's investing his wealth
in that team.
The only question mark is what
his plans are to take the team to the top.
After the consortium
came in and bought the team,
there was a change in the driver lineup.
In comes Lawrence's son,
Lance Stroll.
[Lance] Well, my dad and I have
a pretty good relationship, I'd say.
{\an8}You know, we go way back.
{\an8}[laughs] Yeah.
[commentator speaking French]
[Lance] He bought me a go-kart
when I was six years old.
He's supported me
throughout my whole career.
and introduced me to the sport
at a very young age.
A lot of people think
Lance Stroll's always had it easy,
given that his father's
one of the most successful businessmen
in the world.
[crowd cheering]
But you don't win championships
just by being rich.
You gotta be talented, you gotta be quick.
There is a very fast driver
underneath that helmet.
[Lance] What makes me
as good a driver as I am?
My commitment.
My commitment is what makes me
such a good driver.
I'm willing to go above and beyond
to tick every box.
Cool.
[suspenseful music playing]
[Perez] Have you heard anything?
[Lance] All I heard is
Mercedes is gonna be quick.
{\an8}-[Perez] We can be strong this year.
-[Lance] We nailed it this year.
-Yeah.
-[Perez] No?
[Lance] Time will tell.
This season, people are buzzing, you know?
You can feel the energy in this building.
I see smiles, and, uh,
you know, I see, I see a vision.
We're ready to take it on.
[reporter]<i>The outbreak centers</i>
<i>on the city of Wuhan.</i>
<i>Although person-to-person transmission</i>
<i>has been confirmed,</i>
<i>it does not, thankfully, spread easily.</i>
-[Otmar] What are we, five minutes away?
-[Helyar] We are indeed.
-Yeah, so the launch we've got at 2:30.
-[Otmar] It looks good? You've seen it?
-[Helyar] Yeah. The car looks great.
-I can't wait.
[Helyar] So I think… Lawrence is there.
-He arrived?
-Yeah.
-[Otmar] Lance?
-Yep.
[Otmar] With him? Very good.
Hello. Hello. How are you?
-It's definitely pink.
-[woman] Hello.
-How are you?
-I just want to have a quick look.
We've done a lot of work over the winter,
preparing this year's car.
-Well done.
-[woman] Looks all right.
-Amazing.
-[Otmar] It's well done.
-[woman] Yeah.
-Really, really good.
Last season, we were seventh,
coming off of a… a difficult year.
This year's season, Lawrence says
he wants everything to be six-star.
[Lance] Looking very dapper, Otmar.
I bought this this morning. All this.
-[Lance] Can you do up your button?
-No.
[all laugh]
-[Lance] All right.
-I look like a stuffed sausage. [laughs]
I'm not new to the team.
I've been there for ten years.
-The car's good in the simulator.
-Looks good.
We got a lot of work to do
to set up though.
-[Lance] Yeah.
-Oh, there's…
When you get new ownership,
um, you've got to manage that situation.
It's highly likely when ownership changes
that the, uh, senior management changes.
You have to finalize it before we leave.
-I gotta leave with Lance...
-4:30.
-4:30, wheels up.
-Okay, four o'clock.
-I gotta finish the prospectives tonight.
-Let's finish it.
Good. I gotta be in the car at 4:00.
[Otmar] Very good.
[dramatic music playing]
You know, job security can be
a bit precarious within Formula 1.
He'll want to see results in 2020.

the cars work exactly as planned,
and it's smooth sailing.
[commentator] <i>True to form, Hamilton</i>
<i>to the top. He's on a screamer, isn't he?</i>
But that only happens very, very rarely.
[commentator]
<i>Oh, and he's spun! He's spun it.</i>
[Max] Jesus Christ.
<i>-</i>[commentator] <i>He's grinding to a halt.</i>
-[Latifi] Yeah, dropping out.
Jump out. Yes.
[commentator] <i>Not ideal.</i>
<i>Second failure for Williams.</i>
[Buxton] And, for the drivers,
it's a huge challenge.
[commentator] <i>Big spin for Vettel.</i>
[Buxton] They have just three days each
to get to grips with the car
that they hope
will be taking them to race victories
and potentially world championship glory.
[commentator] <i>Decent lap there</i>
<i>from Carlos Sainz.</i>
<i>That McLaren's not looking too bad</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
{\an8}[Zak] I'm always excited
to go into a new racing season.
{\an8}There's so many unknowns.
We have such a great history in the sport.
When I joined, uh,
the team was very much, uh, struggling.
But we finished fourth last year
and, uh, we'd like to close the gap.
We've got, uh, two outstanding drivers.
One very young and, uh,
pretty new to the sport in Lando Norris.
You know, Lando could be
one of the future stars of Formula 1.
[Lando] Normally, when I do warm-ups,
I get too tired before I get in the car.
[Jon chuckles]
I do nothing
and then my warm-up's on the out lap.
It's what an out lap's for.
A warm-up lap to warm me up.
[Jon] Four...
I don't think this is, uh,
as action-packed as Carlos' warm-up.
[Jon snickers]
-It's more chilled, you know?
-[Jon] Cool. Anything else you want?
[Lando] No. A lie-down.
[Buxton] This is Lando's second season
in Formula 1.
Zak wants McLaren to be a new version
of this incredibly successful team
that we all know.
There's a lot of faith
being put in a guy who's still so young.
[Joseph] <i>Okay, Lando.</i> <i>Drive straight out.</i>
[Lando] Yeah, confirm.
[Zak] Expectations will be higher
on Lando this year.
For himself, from the team, from the fans,
'cause he's, he's not a rookie<i>.</i>
[commentator] <i>Lando Norris,</i>
<i>in an F1 car for the first time in 2020.</i>
<i>Wait for it.</i>
[engine revving]
[Joseph] <i>Okay, Lando. Give it everything.</i>
[Lando] Yeah, confirm.
[Joseph] <i>Scenario seven. Scenario seven.</i>
[commentator] <i>Looking really fast.</i>
<i>Really pushing that car to its limits.</i>
<i>Coming through the final corner</i>
<i>to complete the lap.</i>
<i>Lando Norris. A 1:24.981.</i>
<i>He's gone fastest.</i>
-[Joseph] <i>OK, Lando, fastest lap.</i>
-[Lando squeals]
[Joseph] <i>Well done.</i>
[Lando] Awesome job, boys.
[tense music playing]
[Lance] I like to stay in the shadow, and,
when it's time,
jump out and shine.
I'm looking forward to getting
behind the wheel for the first time.
[Buxton] With Racing Point,
the car that left the garage on day one,
in terms of its color scheme,
looked very similar to the one
that was released to the press.
But the car itself
had undergone some dramatic changes.
It was
quite familiar
to everyone in the pit lane.
[rock music playing]
[Lance] Radio check, loud and clear?
[Joyce] <i>Track is clear.</i>
[Gow] When the Racing Point
came out of the garage,
I think everybody's jaws dropped.
[Buxton] It was, shall we say,
very inspired by last year's
championship-winning Mercedes.
[Gow] I think a lot of people
in the paddock thought,
"Hang on. What's going on here?"
[Joyce] <i>You're good to go. Go, one.</i>
[Lance] Go!
[commentator] <i>Stroll now. Here we go.</i>
[Horner] That fucking Racing Point
is quick.
Yeah, there's something a bit weird.
[Joyce] <i>OK, Lance.</i>
<i>Keep pushing. Keep pushing.</i>
[commentator]
<i>He's gone fastest in Sector 1.</i>
<i>He's the fastest in Sector 2.</i>
<i>They look phenomenal.</i>
<i>It looks like it's going to be the fastest</i>
<i>lap of the day, and of the test.</i>
<i>-</i>[Joyce] <i>Fastest car on track..</i>
-[Lance] Nice one, guys.
[commentator] <i>It's mind-blowing.</i>
[Buxton] It's worth remembering
that there are the rules.
You have to design and build your own car.
Now, the closer that car is
to one that's gone before,
especially if it's one
that absolutely dominated
the previous season's world championship,
the more people are going to ask questions
as to whether that's entirely fair.
And, most of all, whether it's legal.
[reporter] You may not have been looking
at the numbers. We were.
But being around the same pace as Ferrari
can't be bad.
No. But, uh, yeah, it's early days, so…
We'll see. We'll see.
[reporter] How is it, every time we ask
you or Sergio about the pace of the car,
you can't wipe the grin off your face?
Sun is shining. We're in Barcelona.
Could be worse. Life's good.
[reporter] Reckon they've leapfrogged you?
[Lando] Difficult to say.
I don't wanna comment too much.
I mean,
it looks like a Mercedes, that's for sure.
I don't know how… what the idea
and the process is behind it.
[Horner] It's almost a,
uh, an identical replica.
I think the question,
the bigger question is, is it allowed?
[Zak] I think it's, it's a bit surprising
they weren't maybe
a little bit more discreet.
[Cyril] Is it something
that has been designed by your team?
Is it something that's been copied?
I think it's very easy to agree
that we need to put a light on this story.
So there is no reason to delay.
[Otmar] What we've done over the winter
is, uh, is completely legal,
and we took inspiration
from the fastest car on the grid,
but it's no different
than what other teams do.
[Steiner] For sure, there will be
quite heated discussions going on,
because, if it was copied,
that's, in my opinion,
not legal.
[machinery whirs]
[Lawrence] Formula 1,
it is a political nightmare,
and everyone does have their own agendas.
Thankfully,
I leave that to Otmar to get on with,
and distance myself from it
as much as I can.
And, uh… I'll leave it at that.
[commentator]
<i>This will be a very interesting season.</i>
<i>Let's see how this all plays out</i>
<i>in the first race.</i>
[exciting music playing]
[commentator 1]
<i>Finally, everybody, it's here!</i>
[commentator 2] Welcome to Australia.
[commentator 1]
<i>Round 1 of the 2020 season.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Other sporting events</i>
<i>may have been canceled by coronavirus,</i>
<i>but Formula 1 bosses insist</i>
<i>that this race is going ahead.</i>
[cheering]
[indistinct chattering]
-[Albon] The Netflix crew.
-[crew chuckles]
It's still too early in the season
to abuse you guys.
Give it, like, another week.
I think Australia
is always super exciting.
-[man] Hello, Lando. Good luck.
-Thanks very much.
It comes with a high degree of pressure.
You get a lot of anxiety.
Coming out of winter testing,
you can't underestimate the competition.
First race.
I gotta go this way.
It's a great spectacle, Melbourne.
There's a bit of sour grapes
about this year's car.
If they saw what they saw,
but we weren't quick,
you think anybody would've complained?
Probably not.
And in the meantime, uh,
we gotta get prepared for a race.
[paparazzo]
Straight down the middle. Lovely.
[camera shutters clicking]
Clack, clack, clack, clack.
-[Albon] It says, "Kills coronavirus?"
-[Max] It kills coronavirus?
-Why don't we just gel our whole body?
-I know.
[Tim] The key stuff
is gonna be coronavirus.
Uh, I know the team's working,
uh, very hard every day
to put the right measures in place.
Starting with a full-on face gas mask.
-[Tim] Mm.
-[Lando laughs] You get zipped up.
[snickering]
[Tim] Focus.
[Lando] Ladies.
-Are you excited?
-Yeah.
-Are you?
-Yeah.
We all look so depressed to be racing.
Have you seen?
[both laugh]
-[Albon] For him, he looks quite happy.
-Yeah.
This corner is notorious
for dipping your wheel off.
[engineer]
What are your general thoughts?
-Gonna struggle into turn one.
-Yeah?
[Lando] I can't remember that last year.
-I remember talking about one and three.
-Yeah.
[Lando] Australia was my first track
last year in Formula 1.
It was my most nerve-racking race
in my life. [chuckles]
I'm gonna be, like, here, on the grass.
[engineer]
Did you see the onboard of Verstappen?
-[Lando] Yeah.
-[engineer] He is literally here.
[Lando] Yeah. I'm gonna be more than that.
I would love to say a podium
as a target to have.
[engineer] Turn 11.
This is genuinely one of the ones
I couldn't think of much to say about.
-[Lando] Flat.
-Send it.
There's always a possibility
something can happen.
So the latest rumor we heard,
there are three or four
people in the paddock
with suspected coronavirus.
-[Albon] Really? Whoa!
-[Lugg] Suspected.
[Albon] Shit! Fuck. We're gonna be,
like, put under quarantine.
[Lugg] But I guess the thing is
if those people actually have it,
then the whole paddock will have it.
[commentator] <i>The opening race</i>
<i>of the Formula 1 season in Melbourne</i>
<i>still looks as though</i>
<i>it's going to go ahead,</i>
<i>despite two members of the McLaren team</i>
<i>having shown some coronavirus symptoms.</i>
Could you sign that for me, please?
[Sainz] Sorry, they don't let me
touch any pen that is not mine.
I don't know what can happen.
You just gotta smile and wave.
[Lance] Man, I think this paddock's gonna
just, like, implode from coronavirus.
[Zak] One of our mechanics had symptoms.
He described what he was feeling
and, uh, that doesn't sound good.
Now, we're getting tested.
We're very nervous.
I think people are scared.
This situation, this is about the health
and safety of your entire racing team,
the other racing teams,
the fans, the officials.
We have no idea what's gonna happen
in the… in the future.
What if they ask, "Do you think it's right
that we're racing this weekend?"
[Lando] I'd say, um,
"Absolutely, it's a risk."
"But at the same time,
if we take the right precautions,
I see no problem with it."
And, ultimately, it's a matter for…
Formula 1 and the FIA.
[Lando] Yeah.
Microphone. It's been cleaned.
[reporter 1] Is it right
that a member of your McLaren setup
had to be isolated because of coronavirus?
The fact that he's isolated
doesn't mean he has coronavirus.
Only time will tell.
[reporter 2] If one of your guys
went down with this virus,
would you still race?
[Lando] I think I'd still race.
Uh…
But… Yeah. I would still race.
Um…
And are you worried in any way about this?
About the virus?
[Lando] Um, I mean,
I'm worried if I get it, of course.
-[reporter 2] Stay well, Lando.
-Sorry?
Stay well.
-You too.
-[reporter 2] Thank you.
[woman] What's that?
-[man] The US have closed their border.
-[woman] Have they?
The NBA season's done.
-No way!
-[man] Whole season.
-Yeah.
-[woman] When did they do this?
[Gow] All of a sudden,
everybody's hearing whispers about,
"Oh, someone's being tested."
There's a lot of different opinion.
I think it comes down to a 50-50 split
of those who are in favor of continuing
and those
who just want everything to stop.
[announcer] Welcome to our first
drivers' press conference of 2020
ahead of the season-opening
Australian Grand Prix on Sunday.
Let's open this up to the floor now.
Alex Kalinauckas, <i>Autosport</i>.
A question for Lewis.
Um, regarding the coronavirus situation,
are you comfortable
having traveled all the way to Australia
and are you satisfied with what Formula 1
and the FIA have done so far?
Um, I am really
very, very surprised that we're here.
For me, it's shocking
that we're all sitting in this room.
Um, so many fans here already today.
Um, yeah,
Formula 1 continues to go on, and, um…
So, no, to your answer.
If we could
take our next question, please.
Lewis, you've been outspoken, where others
maybe have not dared to be, about corona.
[stammers] What do you think is the reason
why this race is still going on?
Why are we still here?
-Cash is king?
-Cash is king.
Uh, I… Honestly, I don't know.
I can't really add much more to it.
[commentator 1]
<i>Strong words from Lewis Hamilton.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Lewis Hamilton made</i>
<i>his feelings pretty clear, cash is king.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Not impressed</i>
<i>that the race, at the moment,</i>
<i>is still going ahead.</i>
Anyway, nobody has an official statement,
so we're waiting.
[reporter] Like everything
with this coronavirus scare
around the world,
information is coming at rapid pace
and it's changing,
quite literally, every minute.
That's what the--
They said four Haas people
have gone into the hospital.
The moment that one gets coronavirus,
this is killed.
[Lando] Gone. Boom. Out.
[anchor 1] <i>In the last few minutes,</i>
<i>it's emerged</i>…
[anchor 2] …<i>that a McLaren team member</i>
<i>has tested positive for coronavirus.</i>
Got a phone call from,
uh, our team manager
to say that we'd had a positive case.
Suddenly, this situation has blown up,
with a McLaren mechanic testing positive.
Our position is we should race.
Keep testing,
and if the situation develops further,
um, you know, review it in 24 hours.
{\an8}I definitely don't want us to go ahead.
I don't think we should.
We, uh, really looked forward
to racing in Melbourne.
And, from a team perspective,
we still wanna race.
[anchor 3] <i>There's another development</i>
<i>from Melbourne.</i>
<i>Authorities have confirmed that…</i>
[announcer] Thank you very much
for your patience.
For us, it was an easy decision.
Ultimately, we are out.
[reporter] It has just landed.
A joint statement
between the FIA, Formula 1
and the Australian Grand Prix Corporation
that this Grand Prix has been canceled.
-It will not take place.
-Uh, unbelievable.
The Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix
has been canceled.
[jeering]
[anchor 4] <i>This weekend's</i>
<i>Australian Grand Prix has been canceled.</i>
<i>-</i>[anchor 5] <i>The Australian Grand Prix--</i>
-[man]<i> </i>I want my money back!
[announcer] We'd appreciate it
if you would make an orderly exit
towards the tram stations.
Thank you.
Disgusting.
It's disgusting for everybody here.
-Cash is king! Cash is king!
-[man] Why aren't we allowed in there?
[reporter] Can you summarize,
in a few sentences,
what happened the last 24 hours?
[Horner] Uh, it's obviously frustrating.
When we arrived in Australia,
the intention was to go racing.
The important thing now is
to make sure that we get
all members of staff home safely.
[reporter] Not to Bahrain?
No. I think it's fairly inevitable,
if we're not racing here,
we won't be racing in Bahrain.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks.
[Horner] Formula 1
without races doesn't exist.
At the end of the day, we're dealing
with people's livelihoods, their jobs.
Their way of earning a living.
[anchor 6] <i>Plenty of question marks</i>
<i>now remain over the season.</i>
[anchor 7] <i>Seems like it will be</i>
<i>a huge, long-term issue.</i>
[anchor 6]
<i>Everything is in uncharted territory.</i>
[engine accelerating fades]
[whistling, cheering fade]
[somber music playing]
[Zak] I don't know
if our sponsors are gonna stay around.
I don't know if fans
are gonna be able to attend events.
Uh, I don't know if Grand Prix
are gonna be able to be put on,
which gives us the revenue
to build race cars.
[commentator] <i>Lights out and away we go!</i>
[Horner] Australia's gone, China's gone,
Vietnam's gone, Bahrain's gone.
Smaller teams,
uh, will be… will be struggling.
So there is indeed a genuine risk
for the sport and for Formula 1.
[Claire] We could potentially lose
a number of teams here.
As an independent team,
are we actually going to survive this?
[Horner] What happens from here?
{\an8}I'm sorry, you will have to wait.
You're way too hot.
{\an8}[Lando] That's just the way I am.
[Zak] We were finally able
to have a Grand Prix.
The stakes have never been higher.
[Horner] I look forward to seeing Toto.
Hopefully give him a harder time
this year.
Fuck, again!
{\an8}The big story remains Racing Point.
{\an8}[Cyril] We're not fighting
a level playing field.
{\an8}They're dragging our name through the mud.
I will not accept this.
[Leclerc] The car is so hard to drive.
[smashing]
Fuck!
[tense music playing]{\an8}I don't think anybody could have predicted
the speed and the damage that this virus
{\an8}you know, could and has done.
{\an8}There's no plan for the race team,
no plan for the race cars,
{\an8}but also no plan for ourselves.
{\an8}It's terrifying.
Each and every day, it's terrifying.
We've got to get back
so that all ten teams have a chance,
not a guarantee, but a chance of survival.
[machinery whirring]
[engine revving]
[melancholic music playing]
{\an8}[indistinct announcement on PA]
{\an8}[man over PA]
<i>Just a heads up, Mr. Zak Brown is on-site.</i>
{\an8}[Zak] Only the second time
I've been in my office
{\an8}since the race getting canceled
in Australia.
Feels like a sci-fi movie.
Very bizarre.
[elevator announcement] <i>Level plus one.</i>
[Zak] It's no secret we had
our financial challenges through COVID.
It's devastated businesses.
It brought us to a standstill.
That means job redundancies and pay cuts.
Just impossible to know, uh,
what the future has in front of us,
and I think all we can do now
is hope for the best.
[cell phone ringing]
[cell phone continues ringing]
Hey, how are you?
{\an8}Yeah, good. Just at the office.
{\an8}Yeah. Quiet<i>.</i>
Do you think there's a scenario
where you could even just get 15 races in?
So what does that then look like?
Two Austria, then Hungary.
Europe, Middle East,
global.
Sounds like everything is under control.
All right. Good stuff.
{\an8}<i>There is good news coming out of Formula 1</i>
<i>as racers dust off their cars</i>
<i>and get underway</i>
<i>with the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>
<i>The British Formula 1 Grand Prix</i>
<i>will go ahead in July.</i>
[notifications pinging]
Ah, morning, Netflix. Back for more.
Two meters this year though.
You gotta keep your distance.
[exciting music playing]
[call dialing out tone]
[answerphone] <i>The person you are calling</i>
<i>is unable to take your call.</i>
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>
Drivers. It's a problem.
It's probably too early in the morning.
I'm just grateful that we're...
we're racing.
I think, to get the series up and running,
it's been a phenomenal effort.
You know, I've had ten weeks
sitting at home, not doing anything.
Teams are gonna be race-rusty
on the strategy, on the pit stops.
And I think that this year
will create some different scenarios.
But it feels like Mercedes
could be vulnerable this year.
I think this work from home thing's
been taken to an extreme in marketing.
"Work from home." We never saw 'em again.
{\an8}The way this is structured
is everybody gets a section of questions.
They will direct a question to you
when they want you to answer.
-It's not interactive between me and Toto?
-It doesn't appear to be.
So I can't take the piss
out of this haircut.
[laughs] It doesn't appear to be.
Ask Susie,
"Have you been cutting Toto's hair?"
[woman] Right, Christian, if you want
to grab a seat in the hot seat.
Hey, Susie, how are you?
<i>-</i>[Susie] <i>Good, Christian. How are you?</i>
<i>-</i>Good. You got Toto doing the housework?
-[Susie] <i>No. No chance on that one.</i>
-[laughs]
I'm in my kitchen.
{\an8}<i>-It's a nice kitchen.</i>
-[Susie laughs]
{\an8}<i>That's a great kitchen.</i> [chuckles]
<i>Toto's gonna be really looking forward</i>
<i>to getting back to racing.</i>
Personally, I'm looking forward
to seeing Toto again
and hopefully giving him a harder time
this year.
[Toto] <i>Absolutely.</i>
<i>We are fierce competitors,</i>
{\an8}<i>but I, personally, actually look forward</i>
<i>to the racing itself.</i>
<i>Forget all the rest around it,</i>
<i>um, let's just race.</i>
[producer] How long do you think it'll be
until the gloves<i> </i>just come off?
I reckon about two o'clock Sunday.
Sunday afternoon in Austria.
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Good morning, everybody,</i>
<i>from the Styrian Hills. We're in Austria.</i>
<i>This is the first race</i>
<i>in the 2020 Formula 1 season.</i>
<i>The arena is open for business.</i>
<i>The 20 gladiators return.</i>
[Daniel] Bonjour!
[man] Perfect.
That's deep.
[chuckling]
[woman] Sorry, you will have to wait.
You're way too hot.
[Lando] That's just the way I am.
Would you like to say hello to the fans?
-[George] We've actually got fans here?
<i>-</i>[fan 1] <i>Yeah.</i>
Check this out.
Hiya. How are you doing?
<i>-</i>[fan 2] <i>Morning, Lance.</i>
-Morning. Hello.
I'm really impressed by this.
This is awesome.
I think you're on mute.
-Wait for it.
<i>-</i>[fan 3] <i>Can you hear me?</i>
Yep. What's going on?
You can ask me a question, or I can just
stand here and dance or something.
-I don't know. As you will.
-[fan 3 chuckles]
<i>I want to see you dance, please.</i>
Aaah! [laughs]
I shouldn't have said that!
I shouldn't have said that.
The Austrian Grand Prix
is an absolute marker in the ground
that, you know,
Formula 1 is open for business again.
[reporter speaking indistinctly]
After lockdown, we are finally able
to take the covers back off the race cars
and have a Grand Prix.
{\an8}Getting into the paddock,
seeing the people again,
{\an8}knowing that you can get back soon racing,
the feeling is fantastic.
-[Toto] Morning.
-[man] I won't shake your hand.
[man chuckles]
[Toto] I'm very much looking forward
to going racing again.
As an Austrian, I enjoy being in Austria.
As a racing team,
it's back to what we love in the sport,
and that is the stopwatch.
[Horner] Hey. I don't know what to do.
Do I touch you? Do I--
[Toto] I don't think we can hug.
-[Horner] Good. You been okay?
-[Toto] Yeah.
[Toto] Christian, to give him credit,
{\an8}he came into the sport very young.
[crowd cheering, whistling]
[Toto] He was put in charge
of the Red Bull Formula 1 team
and won four championships.
[crowd cheering]
[Buxton] Red Bull ruled the roost
for four years
{\an8}and then along came Toto and Mercedes
and stole their ball.
And Christian wants it back.
It's incredibly hard
to keep that level of winning consistency,
and all credit to Mercedes.
We managed it for four years.
They've managed it for six.
But inevitably,
at some point, that comes to an end.
[Max] Christian. Are we allowed to…
-Are we allowed to shake or not?
-[woman] Probably not.
-[Horner] No, what about this?
-[Max] We do a little toe hug.
-It's all right.
-[Horner] Good.
{\an8}Have you been OK?
{\an8}[Max] It's good to be back
after such a long break.
{\an8}-[Horner] It's crazy, isn't it?
-Yeah.
Stronger and fitter than ever.
That's good.
But we also have more time,
so you would expect that.
[Horner] Max is,
arguably, the hottest property
in Formula 1 at the moment.
{\an8}[crowd cheering]
{\an8}The thing about Max
is he's got this magic dust about him.
The dream is
to win a fifth world championship,
to make Max the youngest
Drivers' World Champion ever.
[Harding] Three, two, one.
[Horner] Alex is Max's teammate.
He had a really solid,
you know, nine races for us,
and put in a very strong performance.
Yes. Come on!
[Horner] He could be
the surprise of this season.
-Yes!
-Come on!
[Lugg] <i>Excellent work, Alex.</i>
<i>Thumbs up, mate.</i>
[Horner] With Max, with Alex,
we've got two cars
in the fight with Mercedes.
This is our best shot
to win this championship,
you know, since 2013.
[ethereal music playing]
[Zak] Hello? Hello? Where's our entrance?
-[man] Our entrance is that one.
-[Zak] That one?
-[man] There other one.
-[Zak] Oh, here we go.
It's too long
since I've been at the track.
[machinery chugging]
[Claire] It's gonna be really interesting
to see where the drivers all lie
after lockdown.
[Kevin] I feel excited about getting back
in the car. It's been such a long time.
You know, you get itchy, uh,
itchy feet and hands,
getting back in the car.
[Daniel] I'm ready to get back into it.
We've got an acronym, "FSU."
"Fuck shit up."
That's what I'm hoping to do.
[Sainz] It's such a good racetrack,
so I cannot wait to get on track, be fast.
[Rupert] Don't forget the boots, mate.
[Zak] Everyone will be a bit rusty,
but you get back in the swing of things.
[Tom] <i>And radio check.</i>
[engine revving]
[commentator 2] <i>It is time for the cars</i>
<i>to take to the track.</i>
[tires squeaking]
[engineer] <i>You're free. Go push.</i>
[producer] Max said
he doesn't need to do any practice.
He just needs two laps,
he'll be switched on.
And that's what… These guys,
they're the pinnacle, aren't they?
{\an8}They should just be able to flip a switch
and they're back onto it.
{\an8}[metal crunching]
[Latifi] <i>Fuck.</i>
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>
Our goal is to get closer to third,
but the<i> </i>competition's tough.
You have Racing Point.
[commentator 1] <i>Sergio Perez,</i>
<i>fastest for Racing Point.</i>
And then Renault.
Extremely strong.
[commentator 1]
<i>Daniel Ricciardo, fifth fastest.</i>
[Zak] It's gonna be a big fight.
[Garcia] Let's maximize
our time on the track.
[Lando] It's the longest
I've been out of a race car in…
{\an8}Well, since I started go-karts
back in 2007.
Things were pretty much just playing games
and streaming on Twitch.
And that was pretty much my life.
Now there's just so much excitement.
Just being able to do what I love,
driving a Formula 1 car.
Just going to take a few laps
to get back into it.
In Austria, you've got a massive
long straight as you come out the pits,
and you put your throttle down.
Your head gets put back
against the headrest.
Your body gets compressed.
Then you hit the brakes
for the first time.
My head just fell forward
and it just felt like I was,
I'd never driven a car before.
It just feels a bit alien really.
But within a couple of laps,
it just felt like I was back home again.
[Lambiase] Uh, <i>Max, can I have</i>
<i>engine five, position two, please.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Looking a very strong lap by Verstappen.</i>
<i>-</i>[commentator 2] <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>-Personal best.</i>
We've had a habit of coming out the blocks
a little slowly the last few years.
We need to address that<i>.</i>
We have to believe in ourselves.
We have to beat Mercedes.
-You're back up to speed quick.
[Max] Yeah. That's always the goal.
-[Horner] Did it feel quick?
-No, it was all right.
It's fast, don't get me wrong,
but, like, it feels all right.
[engine revving]
{\an8}[Bono] OK, <i>Lewis,</i>
<i>so circuit's all clear. All clear.</i>
{\an8}<i>Give yourself a bit of room</i>
<i>so you are safe.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Lewis Hamilton on track at the moment</i>.
[commentator 4] <i>There's a lot of intrigue</i>
<i>around the Mercedes.</i>
[commentator 5] <i>There's something</i>
<i>very interesting going on in the cockpit.</i>
<i>Yeah. There we go.</i>
<i>That's the DAS.</i>
[commentator 4]
<i>The steering, moving about.</i>
[commentator 5] <i>Interesting.</i>
<i>Not seen that before.</i>
<i>Um…</i>
<i>Yeah. As he hits the anchors,</i>
<i>the steering wheel is moving forward.</i>
<i>Yeah, very interesting.</i>
The reason that DAS is so clever,
but also so controversial,
is that Mercedes have been able to create
a system that not only steers the car,
but also, when you pull that wheel out
and push it back in again,
it changes the positioning of the tires
to improve grip,
which should give extra speed
through the corners.
[Horner] We're giving six tenths,
seven tenths to Hamilton on the straights.
[man 1] We've got seven to eight tenths
in qualifying.
It depends how much they've got.
[Horner] If they've got that much,
then we're fucked.
[cars zooming past]
[Horner] What is he doing with it though?
Does it try and heat tires up or…
[man 2] That's what it looks like.
It's not really a steering system.
[Horner] Right.
[man 3] Is there gonna be a protest?
[Horner] It's the only way to clear it up.
[cell phone ringing]
-[Horner] Hello.
-[Geri] <i>Hi.</i>
[Horner] How you doing?
Monty looks so different
with his hair cut.
{\an8}-[Geri] <i>Talk to Daddy.</i>
-[Horner] How was swimming, Mont?
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Geri] <i>He's getting really good.</i>
<i>-</i>Yeah.
[Geri] <i>How did P3 go?</i>
[Horner] Okay. They were third and sixth.
[Geri] <i>Who was one and two, Mercedes?</i>
[Horner] Ah, yeah, I'm gonna say they look
very strong here, so let's see.
[Geri] <i>Um… okay.</i>
It's all quite tight, apart from Hamilton.
I'm gonna have to go.
-Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.
<i>-</i>[Geri] <i>Bye.</i>
<i>-Love you. Bye.</i>
<i>-</i>Bye. Bye.
Hi, hi, hi.
The DAS system
that they're running on their car,
the steering system,
falls into a very gray zone.
[machine chimes]
So you've got your DAS on the car.
[Toto] We've got the DAS.
[Horner] I know.
Well, don't take it personally.
[Horner chuckles]
[Toto] No, I won't.
[Horner] But we'll protest it today.
And then it's down to the FIA.
They're either happy or they're not.
[Toto] As an innovation, isn't it great?
[Horner] It's clever.
Hats off, full respect.
[Toto] It adds a new dimension to it.
[Horner] I think I'd shit myself
if I pulled a steering wheel
and it went like that. [chuckles]
[Toto] Christian is a good operator.
He likes to have
these little war games between us.
But the rivalry is big.
[upbeat music playing]
[helicopter whirring]
[commentator 1] <i>It's time for qualifying</i>
<i>and the serious business of forming a grid</i>
<i>ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>
<i>It's the season opener</i>
<i>and it's been a long time since</i>
<i>the Formula 1 season began in Europe.</i>
[Horner] There's Mr. Todt.
I'll say hello to him.
{\an8}-How are you?
-[Totd] Fine. You?
{\an8}[Horner] Yeah, okay.
[Totd] Are you quick or not?
{\an8}[Horner] I hope so. We'll see today.
Mercedes is bloody quick.
We tried to slow them down with the DAS,
but no luck.
The FIA have judged DAS to be legal,
which means
Mercedes can use it on their car
until the end of the season.
[reporter 1] Under control.
[reporter 2] You do the foot one.
Is that how you do it?
[Horner] What was the response
to the protest stuff?
I think, from a fan perspective,
people are just saying,
"Red Bull are just responding
to getting whipped on the track."
-[Horner] Yeah.
-'Cause that's what they see.
-So…
-[Horner] We'll see.
[loud whirring]
[commentator 2] <i>So far, this weekend</i>
<i>has been absolutely perfect for Mercedes.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton,</i>
<i>heading every single session.</i>
<i>Mercedes, the favorites for pole today.</i>
-[Horner] They're bloody quick.
-They're strong.
-Even stronger than we expected.
-[Horner] Unbelievable.
[commentator 2] <i>But what have Red Bull,</i>
<i>with Alex Albon and Max Verstappen,</i>
<i>got up their sleeves?</i>
-Let's see what happens in this session.
-It's gonna be tough for Alex.
[Horner] If he can get in the top six,
that'll be okay.
[Gow] Alex had a really good
second part to the season last year,
{\an8}and now he comes into the races this year
ready to score big points.
Ready to help Red Bull
in their fight against Mercedes.
-[Lugg] Okay, Alex.
-Yep?
-[Lugg] You can fire up.
<i>-</i>Copy.
[engine revving]
[tires squealing]
[Horner] Alex has ticked all the boxes
with how he races.
I think it's only a matter of time
before he achieves that first podium.
He did have a chance last year in Brazil,
but it all went a bit wrong.
{\an8}[commentator 1]
<i>Alex Albon should have this wrapped up.</i>
<i>Hamilton now is gonna try</i>
<i>and take second place.</i>
{\an8}[Lugg] <i>Alex, hold Hamilton up.</i>
<i>Keep your position.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Albon locks up.</i>
{\an8}[Horner]
Hamilton inexplicably turned him round.
{\an8}-[Albon] Fuck!
-[screaming]
<i>-</i>[commentator 1] <i>Albon's been hit!</i>
-[man] Fuck!
{\an8}[commentator 1]
<i>The chance of his first podium, gone.</i>
[Albon] It was painful.
Frustrating. But if I did it again,
I would've been more aggressive.
I know what I need to do,
and now it's more about just
getting them results in.
{\an8}[Lugg] <i>Okay, Alex.</i>
<i>You'll get one timed lap.</i>
[Albon] Yep, copy.
[commentator 2] <i>The moment of reckoning.</i>
[Lugg] No lift off Turn 1.
[Albon] This car still feels very nervous.
[tires screeching]
[Lugg] Work the brakes.
[Albon] Okay, copy.
[man 1] Alex, come on!
-Go on, boy!
-Come on!
[commentator 1]<i> Albon goes fourth fastest.</i>
<i>But Norris is on a flyer just behind.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>We're now onboard</i>
<i>with Lando Norris on a flying lap.</i>
[Joseph] Lando, you're 0.4 seconds quicker
than Albon. Keep this up.
[Zak] Fucking hell!
[Joseph] <i>Push now, please. Push now.</i>
<i>100% pace.</i>
<i>Give it everything.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>Is Lando Norris quicker than Alex Albon?</i>
[mechanic] Oh, he's quicker.
[commentator 1] <i>Norris steals fourth</i>
<i>from Albon.</i> <i>What a lap.</i>
[cheering, applause]
Yeah!
[Joseph] <i>Lando, P4, mate. Amazing job. P4.</i>
[gleeful chuckling, whooping]
[commentator 2]
<i>Lewis Hamilton on his final flying lap.</i>
{\an8}<i>DRS, wide open then for Lewis Hamilton.</i>
{\an8}<i>Oh, and someone's had a problem.</i>
{\an8}<i>And it's Valtteri Bottas</i>
<i>going off into the gravel.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Yellow flag out there.</i>
<i>Does that mean Hamilton has to back off?</i>
If Lewis Hamilton drove through
a yellow-flag zone without slowing down,
it will be considered to be dangerous
and the penalty will be severe.
{\an8}[Lewis] Did they show a yellow flag?
I couldn't see with the dust.
[commentator 2]
<i>Hamilton rounds the final corner.</i>
<i>So it looks like Lewis's time stands.</i>
<i>He takes second place,</i>
<i>behind Bottas on pole,</i>
<i>and Mercedes qualify one-two for the race.</i>
-[Horner] Well done. Ish.
-Yeah.
[Horner] A yellow flag is that you have to
show caution and slow down.
The drivers know.
They've grown up with that
since their first races in karting.
[Max] Looking at his lap time,
I'm pretty sure he didn't lift.
[Horner] He should get a fucking penalty.
Against a Mercedes team
that is so strong, so dominant,
you have to exploit every opportunity
that you possibly can.
[commentator 2] <i>It's here.</i>
<i>Round 1 of the 2020 season.</i>
<i>We're in Austria around the Red Bull Ring.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
[Buxton] Christian Horner aims
to disrupt Mercedes
in any way that he can.
So, yeah, you'll protest DAS.
Yeah, you'll protest that qualifying lap.
[Horner]
You're not gonna win championships
by just sitting back
and accepting everything.
So we've got to push.
He's like a dog with a bone.
He won't let go.
[Horner] We found some more footage
the FIA didn't have, which is crazy,
{\an8}from his camera in his car.
{\an8}And you can clearly see a yellow flag.
The stewards
hadn't looked at that footage.
[Horner] Good luck today.
[man] You put us back three spots now?
Or what happened?
-[Horner] I don't know. We're trying.
-[both chuckle]
Something's gotta slow you down.
-[Lando] I'm starting P3!
-[Malvern] Are you?
-[Lando] Yeah!
-How come? Where's Hamilton, P10?
I don't know. I don't care.
-[Malvern] Maybe thanks to Horner.
-[Lando] Oh yeah.
[Jacques] Three-place penalty
confirmed for Lewis.
Surely the decision was made
before 14:20 on race day?
The timing of it was brilliant.
Because Mercedes
had already made their way to the grid
and were setting up Lewis Hamilton's
grid spot from his original place.
If you're gonna pull the rug
from under your biggest rival,
you wait till the last minute.
[man] I love the idea
of keeping pressure on 'em.
[Horner] Best time to do it.
That'll really ruffle him now.
Anyway, good job.
[Toto] Christian likes to rumble around
a little bit.
But I think
we're doing it a bit different.
We concentrate on ourselves.
We don't look too much left and right.
We do the talking on the track.
[commentator 2] <i>217 days without a race,</i>
<i>the longest period in Formula 1 history,</i>
<i>and finally we can go racing.</i>
[Horner] Seems like a long time
since we've been here.
[commentator 3] <i>After Red Bull's protest,</i>
<i>it's Verstappen up to second,</i>
<i>Lando Norris's best ever start</i>
<i>in third place,</i>
<i>Alex Albon in fourth,</i>
<i>and Hamilton,</i>
<i>well, he's been bumped back down to fifth.</i>
<i>That's a big blow for Toto Wolff</i>
<i>and for Mercedes.</i>
[Zak] I'm always excited,
but I'm always nervous.
You'd like to cruise to victory
anytime you're on a race track,
but you know
it's never gonna quite be that easy.
-At least you have a fast car.
-[Zak] Yeah. We needed that.
Especially after everything we've had
in the last two, three months.
The one thing
that we've talked to Lando about
is just maybe being
a little bit more aggressive.
[Max] We've all got one chance
in this championship,
so it's all about making sure
you're always focused
on what you need to do
to extract the best performance.
[Horner] Have a good one.
I think we're well-equipped.
The drivers are up for it.
Max is in the best shape he's been in.
It'll be down to
who makes the least mistakes,
gets the most out of these early races,
and particularly this weekend.
[engineer] <i>Ten seconds.</i>

-[Lugg] Understood. You're doing great.
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>The last time</i>

<i>Red Bull, Mercedes, Red Bull.</i>

{\an8}<i>Engine nine, position four.</i>

[commentator 2]
<i>What's happened to Max Verstappen?</i>
[clunking]
[Max] I've just stalled.
Tell me something.
[Lambiase] Stand by.
[grinding, weak revving]
[commentator 2] <i>Verstappen,</i>
<i>desperately trying</i>
<i>to get power back into that Red Bull.</i>
[Max] It's going backwards.
This fucking setting!
[Lambiase] Engine nine, position two.
Engine nine, position two.
[grinding]
[Max] It keeps saying the fucking…
I can't change it.
<i>-How can this happen?</i>
-[Lambiase] Okay, Max, box, please. Box.
[Horner] Just gutting.
He is our championship hopeful.
We're in a great position
in the opening race,
in our home Grand Prix.
[grinding]
-[Lambiase] Switch off.
-[Max] Fuck this.
[Horner] And he's out.
It was just a punch in the guts
for the whole team.
But then, you know,
we've still got a car in the race.
{\an8}[Lugg] <i>Great job, mate.</i>
{\an8}[Horner]
It looks like a solid P3 for Alex.
Which… Okay, we've lost Max,
but we should get a podium.
The fact that Albon is fighting
for podiums and a potential victory
shows that he's delivering
on the promise that we believe in him.
That first podium, that first victory,
it removes the pressure.
There's a big difference between thinking
you can do it and knowing you can do it.
[Lugg] Box, Alex, box.
[Albon] Box, box.
[Horner] We put him onto a new set
of tires for the last stint.
[tires screeching]
[Horner] Which, amazingly,
Mercedes didn't cover.
That gave him a significant tire advantage
for what would almost certainly be
his first Grand Prix victory.
[commentator 1] <i>This has worked out</i>
<i>brilliantly for Red Bull.</i>
<i>Albon has a chance at the win.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Albon's got a slipstream</i>

<i>Hamilton has a five-second penalty.</i>
<i>McLaren need to be telling Lando Norris.</i>

<i>He has a five-second penalty.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Norris has a chance of a podium.</i>
[woman 1] Come on, Lando!
[woman 2] Oh my God.
[Lando] I had one and a half laps
to try and somehow gain
this 1.5 seconds
I needed for my first podium in Formula 1.
[Joseph] <i>Go flat out to the end.</i>
<i>Give it everything.</i>
[Lando] I never really thought,
"I can do this,"
because it was Lewis Hamilton
in a Mercedes, who are a lot quicker.
Normally.
It was,
"Forget about everything and just drive."
[Malvern] Please, mate, come on.
[commentator 1] <i>We're on the final lap.</i>
<i>Can Norris find the lap of his life to get</i>
<i>within five seconds of Lewis Hamilton?</i>
Look, how sweaty my hands…
[Lando] I could really push the car

[man] Come on.

[Lando] It was incredible, and insane.
All of a sudden, I go over the line.
[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris</i>
<i>with the fastest lap of the race.</i>
[man] Did he do it or not?
[Joseph] <i>Lando,</i>
<i>the gap to Hamilton was 4.8.</i>
<i>That's a podium.</i>
[cheering, squealing]
[Zak] Yeah!
[Zak laughs]
[Lando] Fuck yeah, boy!
[squealing laughter]
[cheers] Yes!
It was incredible.
[cheering]
[Lando] Something I'll remember
for the rest of my career in Formula 1.
[Lando laughs wildly]
[Zak] Yeah!
Whoo!
[Zak] I'm glad I was able to share
Lando's podium at the start of the season.
That was an awesome reward
for everyone's hard work and dedication
and, um, it was exactly what we needed.
[whooping]
[Horner] Hard luck, mate.
Fuck!
He doesn't like you, does he?
It'll come.
It'll come.
You did nothing wrong today.
[whooping, laughing]
-[Lando] Oh man, that race! [giggles]
-[man] Amazing!
[crowd cheering, applauding]
-[Horner] Chin up. It's gonna come.
-[Albon] See you.
It'll just make you

[Albon] Yeah.
I mean, I would have enjoyed it a lot now.
[Horner] I know. I think we all would.
Cheers.
Fucking hell.
{\an8}[producer] People say
Valtteri is your number two driver.
-Is that fair?
-Fuck you.
-I hate to be second.
-He was a sensational wingman.
Well, first of all, "wingman" hurts.
Everyone's expecting Lewis to win,
but everyone cracks. Action.
{\an8}The pressure is gonna be on Alex.
He needs a bit more
of that "fuck you" attitude.
[commentator]
<i>Oh my goodness, it's a slow stop!</i>
[Steiner] The competitiveness
is not where we want it. Fuck!
We can try again next week, huh?
[upbeat music playing][Bottas] Singing next door.
[chuckles]
[producer] Who is that?
Lewis. Sometimes, he sings.
-[laughs]
-[muffled singing in background]
I think he's a better driver than singer.
[chuckles]
[man] You worried about having Netflix
back in the garage?
{\an8}No. I think people say that,
when Netflix is around, things go bad,
{\an8}but, you know, it's just…
{\an8}Um, how do you say?
It's just a bad coincidence.
-[commentator] <i>Hamilton beats Bottas!</i>
<i>-</i>[Lewis whoops]
[commentator]
<i>It's a Mercedes one-two again.</i>
[Bottas] Having Lewis as my teammate,
he's a multiple world champion,
one of the best ever.
It's pretty tough.
{\an8}[commentator] <i>Mercedes, making it clear</i>
{\an8}<i>they expect</i>
<i>Valtteri to move out of Lewis's way.</i>
<i>It's a Mercedes one-two again.</i>
<i>Bottas finishes second.</i>
<i>And the winner, Lewis Hamilton!</i>
[Bottas] I should be always happy
to be on the podium,
but if your teammate wins
and you are second,
you feel like you lose.
[Lewis] I never in a million years thought
I'd have as many titles as I have.
{\an8}It's a hard thing to kind of grasp.
{\an8}what you've, you know, what I've done,
but it's, for sure, hard for Valtteri.
He wants to be world champion.
[Bottas] I know
I've been second in the past,
but I want to prove
that I'm not just a number two.
-Valtteri was such a sensational wingman.
-Well, first of all, "wingman" hurts.
{\an8}[producer] People say
Valtteri is your number two driver.
{\an8}-Would you say that?
-Fuck you.
{\an8}-[producer] Is that fair?
-Fuck you.
They can't hear your question, right?
-[producer] They might.
-[snickers]
[engines rumbling]
[birds chirping]
[tranquil music playing]
[Bottas] In Finland, it's a different
mindset to many other countries.
Most of us,
we're kind of bit of lone wolves.
Even though it's a team sport,
you have a massive team behind,
in the car, you are there alone.
Finland is a pretty good contrast
to the Formula 1 world.
There's no pressure.
[in Finnish] The sauna is warm.
[Ville] Oh yeah.
[Bottas in Finnish] Balls out.
Aye, aye, aye.
[water sizzling]
[Ville] This is peaceful.
Throwing water on the rocks,
you relax straightaway.
{\an8}[Bottas] Yeah.
[Ville] How are you feeling about it?
[Bottas] Of course,
performance is a big thing, but…
it's not only how good you are at driving.
But what can you do?
-That's just how it is.
-That's just how it is.
[pensive music playing]
[Bottas] I believe, my gut feeling is
that things will end up going well.
Yeah.
[Bottas] Now I just need to step
on the accelerator bloody well.
[in English] I hate to be second.
There's many couch commentators
in the sport,
but I don't let it get to me.
I know what I'm still aiming for
and what I'm capable of.
And Lewis knows how hungry I am
for the wins and for my first title.
-[in Finnish] We shall find out.
-[Ville in Finnish] We shall find out.
-Enough Formula 1 stuff.
-[Bottas] Yeah, definitely.
Let's just look at the swans.

[Felix] Lewis,
yesterday it was announced
that you made the list of the 100
most influential people in <i>Time </i>magazine.
-Congratulations, by the way.
-Cheers, man.
[Bottas] Lewis is a big,
worldwide star compared to me.
[raucous cheering]
[upbeat music playing]
Everyone knows the name Lewis Hamilton.
Not as many people know Valtteri Bottas.
But I feel my strength against him
is that I want the title more than him.
[automated voice] <i>Call ended.</i>
-[man] Thank you, Valtteri.
-Easy.
-Not so exciting to follow. Yeah?
-[man laughs]
The two drivers
actually are just so different.
It's not about schmoozing with each other.
It's about having respect for each other.
[camera shutters clicking]
-[Lewis] Your feet must be on fire.
-[reporter 1] They are pretty hot.
-[Lewis] Yeah.
-[reporter 1] I'm regretting the decision.
-But I am committed to the cause.
-[Lewis chuckles] Of course.
[Toto] Lewis is much more extroverted.
[reporter 2] Are you comfortable?
[Bottas] Ish. Yeah.
-[reporter 2 chuckles]
-It's okay. Cool.
[Toto] And Valtteri is more to himself.
More like the typical Finnish character.
It's always been quite a strong track
for me, so we definitely expect to win.
And having these diverse characters
is a strength of the team,
as long as our objectives are the same.
Looking ahead to this weekend,
how excited are you about potentially
equaling Michael Schumacher's record?
It's very, very surreal to think
that I'm that close to Michael.
But it's not one of my favorite tracks,
so it'll be a real challenge.
I don't know where we're gonna stand,
but we've got to work very hard
to keep this guy behind.
[reporter 2] We're doing a piece
on your teammate.
He's about to break a big record
in the Formula 1 world.
As a teammate, what is it
that makes him so hard to race against?
First of all, for sure, I try to avoid him
breaking that record yet.
Yeah. I just wanna beat him.
Thank you.
[tense music playing]
[machinery whirring]
[engineer 1] <i>2.9.</i>
[engineer 2] There's a noticeable delay
with the wheel going on.
What you wanna do is back it off a bit.
[Bottas] In the team, many people,
even though they wouldn't admit it,
maybe unconsciously, they have number one
and number two driver.
-That's fine.
-[crew member] Is it okay?
[Bottas] Sometimes, the team members,
they had to question themselves,
"Are we giving equal treatment
to Lewis and Valtteri?"
[commentator] <i>Bottas leads.</i>
<i>Hamilton and Vettel, it's wheel to wheel!</i>
At Sochi 2018,
that was a pretty tough race.
[Toto] Valtteri was in
an impossible situation
where we had to make decisions
that are uncomfortable.
[commentator] <i>Valtteri Bottas</i>
<i>has just let Lewis Hamilton pass.</i>
<i>There's Toto Wolff pressing the button.</i>
<i>Clearly his call.</i>
<i>They needed to put one car,</i>
<i>in terms of the championship,</i>
<i>between Hamilton and Vettel,</i>
<i>and Bottas had to be the man.</i>
[radio beeps]
[Bottas] I was gonna go faster next lap.
[Toto] <i>Let's discuss it afterwards.</i>
<i>We'll explain.</i>
[commentator] <i>Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>wins the Russian Grand Prix!</i>
Yeah, that was tough. Tough to accept.
I understand
how difficult it was for Valtteri.
He did a fantastic job today
and deserved to win.
[tense music playing]
[Bottas] I was pretty angry.
Honestly, I was thinking,
"Why do I do this?"
I was even thinking of quitting,
of giving up.
Straight after the race,
I said I would not do it again.
[muffled crowd shouting]
[women muttering indistinctly]
One more.
-[women giggling]
-[camera shutter clicks]
[man] Do you think
Valtteri can still be world champion?
I think Valtteri,
in his mind,
has no doubt that he can be.
But having Lewis as your teammate
is probably the hardest thing
that you can have.
He could beat Michael Schumacher's
90-race win record.
Doesn't get any worse, I guess.
[man] Do you get nervous
on qualifying day?
No.
-[Dom] I can't recommend the cycling here.
-No?
-Did you go to the mountains?
-[Dom] Yeah, then I got arrested.
-Arrested?
-[Dom] Yes.
{\an8}Apparently I entered a military area.
So they stopped me, they kept my passport.
-I got chased by a stray dog at one point.
-[laughs]
Welcome to Russia.
[commentator] <i>Welcome, everybody.</i>
<i>We're here at the Olympic Park,</i>
<i>host of the 2014 Winter Olympics.</i>
<i>And, for the first time this season,</i>
<i>the fans are back!</i>
<i>There are 30,000 here today,</i>
<i>ready for some fast action</i>
<i>on a 3.6 mile circuit.</i>
[machinery whirs]
[Toto] We'll find out
if it's gonna be a good weekend.
A critical part of every qualifying
session is a front-row lockout.
Being able to start first and second
on the grid protects the driver on pole.
[Bottas] At every other track
on the calendar,
the best position to start
is either first or second.
But I think actually, on this track,
to win the race,
you want to start either first or third.
It's nearly one kilometer
into the first corner.
If you are following a car,
it's less air to push away,
so you go faster on the straight.
That's a huge advantage.
[engines revving]
[tense music playing]
[engines rumbling]
[Buxton] Qualifying is all about starting
as high up the grid as you can.
Decided by those finite margins
{\an8}of a hundredth, a tenth of a second.
{\an8}[commentator] <i>Mercedes, now looking for</i>
<i>an eighth consecutive front-row lockout.</i>
{\an8}We've got Valtteri behind four seconds.
<i>The circuit's all clear ahead.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
[commentator] <i>Lewis Hamilton starts</i>
<i>his flying lap.</i>
{\an8}-Strat two.
-[Bottas] Copy.
{\an8}[commentator]
<i>Valtteri Bottas, just about to start his.</i>
[Vowles] Tactics, we're gonna push.
[Bottas] The rear end feels good.
[commentator] <i>Valtteri Bottas,</i>
<i>giving it absolutely everything.</i>
[Vowles] <i>We're in a good position.</i>
[Bottas] I went too deep.
Had a bit of a lockup.
[ominous music playing]
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Vowles] <i>You're slower than Lewis.</i>
<i>-</i>Copy.
<i>-</i>[Vowles] <i>Push all the way to Turn 16.</i>
-Yep.
{\an8}[Vowles] <i>Just keep the pace up.</i>
{\an8}<i>Push hard now.</i>
{\an8}<i>Final corner.</i>
[commentator] <i>Hamilton whips up</i>
<i>a massive lap and goes P1.</i>
[Vowles] <i>Nice work.</i>
<i>That's provisional pole.</i>
{\an8}<i>This will be your last push.</i>
[commentator] <i>Bottas across the line.</i>
<i>Half a second away from Lewis Hamilton.</i>
That's currently P2.
[commentator] <i>It's looking like</i>
<i>a Mercedes one-two tomorrow.</i>
{\an8}<i>It's not done yet though.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen has to do his lap.</i>
{\an8}<i>What's this?</i>
<i>Bottas is giving Verstappen a massive tow.</i>
{\an8}This is going to give the Red Bull
a huge advantage.
[Dom] Let Verstappen go.
Don't give him a tow.
[Angela] Oh God!
[Buxton] Getting a tow essentially means
that a car in front of you
is punching a hole in the air.
There's less wind resistance,
which means that you can drive faster.
Verstappen behind. Don't give him a tow.
Giving a rival a tow is like
giving them an extra 20 horsepower.
[Bottas] On this track, I know,
if you don't make pole,
you need to start third.
To beat Lewis, I always race hard, fair,
but, sometimes, it's like, "Fuck it."
[commentator]
<i>Verstappen has just flown past Bottas.</i>
<i>Verstappen's on the front row!</i>
[laughter]
[Max] Yes!
[laughs] That was a good lap.
[Lambiase] <i>Great job, Max. Good</i>
<i>of Valtteri to give you a tow as well.</i>
[Bottas] After Sochi 2018, I realized
you have to take all your opportunities.
Look how he towed him.
[Dom] I'm sorry.
We need to be more responsive next time.
That's just something we need to work on.
[commentator]
<i>Is that Valtteri Bottas thinking,</i>
<i>"Today's the day</i>
<i>I'm gonna stop being a team member here,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna start putting myself first</i>
<i>a little more often"?</i>
[Dom] <i>That's Lewis, P1,</i>
<i>Verstappen, yourself,</i>
<i>and Verstappen can thank you for the tow</i>.
[commentator] <i>Lewis Hamilton on pole</i>
<i>on the weekend that he's aiming</i>
<i>to equal Michael Schumacher's record.</i>
<i>But it isn't a Mercedes lockout</i>
<i>on the front row.</i>
<i>Verstappen starts second.</i>
<i>Valtteri Bottas starts third.</i>
[Gow] Mercedes have qualified
so well this year.
{\an8}And, all of a sudden,
Max Verstappen is splitting the Mercedes
{\an8}and starting on the front row.
{\an8}It raised a lot of eyebrows
up and down the paddock.
[Toto] Did you see Verstappen,
how he towed him?
That's not the reason he's in front of us.
The reason he's in front of us
is we did a bad lap.
[Toto] No, it's one of the reasons.
We did a bad lap and we towed him.
Both things contributed to not being P2.
We are just trying
to come as close to perfection as we can.
But sometimes the drivers' objectives are
different to the objectives of the team.
[Bottas] I didn't quite understand
why the team
would have been disappointed I was third.
Everyone knew third is better than second.
If I did it on purpose,
only I know.
[chuckles]
But I would have not made it into
this sport if I wasn't selfish at times.
-[reporter] What happened?
-I wish I knew.
I just didn't go quicker,
so maybe I was just playing games,
wanting to start third.
It's a good place to start.
It will give me
an advantage against Lewis.
[Lewis] I don't know why Valtteri
didn't get great laps this afternoon.
Maybe it's tactical.
Don't know how
or why he would do that, so, um, yeah.
It's so important
to have the support of your teammate.
There was a period of time
the guy that has been my teammate
has been my best friend.
But when you work your life to win
and only one of you can win,
it brings a lot of friction.
♪ <i>Champione, champione ♪</i>
<i>♪ Ole, ole, ole ♪</i>
{\an8}To win a world championship,
I dedicated my whole life to it.
{\an8}For me, it makes it all the more sweeter
that Lewis was the guy I managed to beat.
I've known Lewis since I'm 13 years old.
We were teammates in go-karting
and best friends at the time.
[Lewis] I'm just gonna drive my hardest.
{\an8}-Drive smooth and calm and collective.
-I need to finish at the front.
{\an8}Just be careful, then finally
just give it everything. Full speed.
{\an8}[chuckles]
[commentator speaking Japanese]
[commentator speaking Japanese]
[Nico] We were dreaming,
"Imagine if, one day, we can be
in the leading Formula 1 team,
fighting for world championships."
Totally unrealistic.
Then, all of a sudden, it happened.
[engineer] <i>OK, Lewis,</i>
<i>if you let Nico pass this lap.</i>
-[Lewis] I'm not slowing down for Nico.
-[Nico] Why is he not letting me through?
[engineer] <i>He's had the message, Nico.</i>
[Nico] It's unique in sport that
your teammate is your biggest opponent.
With Lewis, it just went too far.
[Lewis] Nico hit me.
Nico's hit me.
This is an absolutely unacceptable race
for us.
I agree. That is unacceptable.
It's probably best I go now.
[Toto] As team principal,
it was almost impossible
to manage the animosity.
We, as a team, cannot let it happen again.
[Nico] Psychology plays a big, big role
in sports. It's huge.
Everybody has self-doubt.
Lewis has self-doubt as well.
You need to amplify that.
You can force him into mistakes.
[Lewis] He's already left?
-We do the longest days.
-[Angela] We do the longest days!
{\an8}-We're always last to leave.
-That's why we're number one.
Tomorrow's gonna be hard.
Mm-hmm.
It's been a real challenge
to raise my level each year
and deliver without making mistakes.
In that battle you have with your mind,
you've got to stay calm, stay in the zone.
-Shoot, man, we haven't skydived for ages.
-[Angela] Oh God, we have to do it.
-[Lewis] I'd like to do bobsleigh.
-Bobsleigh's hardcore.
-You should do skeleton.
-Hell no!
-Where you lay on the thing and go down?
-Head first.
No fucking way.
You're nuts.
-It looks like so much fun.
-It does not look fun at all.
[Angela chuckles]
[both chuckle]
[grunts]
-[Toto] The Mercedes team is hardworking.
-Pushing.
[Toto] Yeah, pushing.
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow. Bye. One of ours.
[crew member counts in German]
[Toto] Lewis equaling Michael's record
with 91 wins
is the main focus that we have now.
It's not great pictures.
[crew member laughs]
Undermines my authority.
But this weekend, it's also important
for Valtteri to make up some points
for his chance to win the championship.
So you never know what to expect.
{\an8}That's the race director, by the way.
{\an8}He's the one everybody complains to.
Exactly. Including you.
Wait tomorrow.
I'll be on the intercom with you.
[grunts]
-[Antti] Is Sochi for your liking?
-Yeah.
Good vodka.
[laughs]
Russian karaoke.
{\an8}[Bottas] We did it once.
{\an8}-Nearly missed the flight the next day.
-Yeah. It was 2015.
{\an8}Good old days. [laughs]
[server] Anything that I can get for you?
-[Tiffany] No, thanks.
-Perfect.
-[server] Enjoy your breakfast.
-Thank you.
Did you get a bit happy last night
on social?
Yeah, so I saw this comment...
What did he comment?
He was basically saying
something negative.
"Lewis will still beat you,"
"You're still shit," basically that.
Yeah. Then I just said,
"If I had your mentality,
I would have given up many times."
The evening before the race, a comment
on social media went under my skin.
People forget that people have feelings
and are real people.
[Bottas] Yes.
But turning anger into motivation
and will to win,
that's very healthy,
if you can control that.
If I listened too much to criticism,
that would be a killer.
There's a Finnish saying. [speaks Finnish]
The translation is…
"Dogs are barking,
but the train keeps going."
[Antti laughs]
[commentator 1]
<i>It is the seventh Russian Grand Prix.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>It is absolutely roasting here.</i>
<i>Track temperature's gonna be</i>
<i>over 40 degrees.</i>
[yelling, cheering]
[commentator 1] <i>Today, Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>is chasing win number 91.</i>
<i>To equal Michael Schumacher's record.</i>
[Horner] I hope we can prevent him
from matching the record
until at least the next race.
[Lambiase] <i>Radio check, Max.</i>
-[Max] Yeah. Radio check.
-[Lambiase] <i>Straight through the pit lane.</i>
[Wolff scats]
[whirring]
[Toto] Are you good at wheel guns?
I should have a go.
I can't be worse than a team principal.
{\an8}-[Lewis] Radio check.
-[Bono] Radio's loud and clear.
Okay, Lewis. It'll be a practice start
from the pit lane.
There is a designated area
to do a practice start
at the end of the pit lane.
Everybody that goes onto the grid
can do a practice start,
but it has to be in that block.
[Lewis] There's all rubber here.
Can I go further out?
[Bono] <i>Um…</i>
<i>Leave enough room for cars to pass.</i>
[Toto] What is this?
[Lewis] <i>To the end of the pit wall?</i>
[Bono] <i>Yeah, copy.</i>
[Toto] Seems an odd thing to do
on the pit wall, no?
[Lewis] I understand the rules.
And I'm always looking
to maximize every opportunity,
plain and simple.
[commentator 1] <i>He's gone a long way out.</i>
<i>That's too far out of the pit lane.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>I'm not entirely sure why</i>
<i>the team okayed</i>
<i>for Lewis to go down there and do it.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>The stewards will not be happy with that.</i>
What Lewis Hamilton did
put others at risk.
If he'd launched himself out when people
were already coming out of the pit lane,
there could've been a massive crash.
[Bono] Okay<i>. We can go to the grid now.</i>
Lewis wanted to maximize
the practice start before the race,
so he could nail it
on the race start itself.
[Bono] <i>So cool the car.</i>
He knows that sometimes the pole
can be less of an advantage.
And maybe
it played games in Lewis's head.
[Bono] <i>All okay with the engine.</i>
Everyone makes mistakes in this sport.
Even the best.
Even Lewis.
[reporter 1] <i>We're just hearing</i>
<i>that Lewis is under investigation</i>
<i>for doing a practice start</i>
<i>outside of the designated area.</i>
<i>He's being investigated.</i>
[reporter 2]
<i>This could have big implications</i>
<i>for his race this afternoon.</i>
[Marko] Hamilton stopped on the track.
-[Horner] Did he?
-[Marko] Yeah.
I think he stopped on the track
and made a practice start.
Surely they can't penalize you in a race
for something that happened earlier?
-That's got to just be a fine.
-Yeah.
[Russian National Anthem playing]
[Toto] I like this national anthem.
It reminds me of Rocky against Ivan Drago.
[giggling]
[commentator] <i>Valtteri needs</i>
<i>a great start from P3 if he wants to win.</i>
<i>He needs to be ahead of Hamilton</i>
<i>going into Turn 2.</i>
Everyone's expecting Lewis to win,
but everyone cracks. Also, Lewis.
I need to keep putting the pressure
on him. I need to keep him on his toes.
[Lewis] Now I'm getting close
to Michael Schumacher.
It's very, very surreal.
[commentator] <i>Could it be the day</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>equals Michael Schumacher's record?</i>
You've got to be able to block it all out
and focus on the one goal.
To win the race. It's intense.
[engineer] <i>Fifteen seconds.</i>
[engines revving]
[suspenseful music playing]
[commentator 1]
<i>And it's Hamilton in the lead!</i>
<i>Bottas is going</i>
<i>round the outside of Hamilton!</i>
<i>Oh, but he's run wide!</i>
<i>Hamilton gets back in front.</i>
<i>Bottas in second.</i>
<i>Carlos Sainz is in the wall.</i>
<i>That's a big crash.</i>
[clunking]
[commentator 2] <i>Lance Stroll is out</i>
<i>of the race and into the barriers,</i>
[commentator 1] <i>They'll need a safety car</i>
<i>on the opening lap of the Grand Prix.</i>
Are you okay?
{\an8}-[Lewis] Is everyone okay?
-[Bono] <i>All okay. Just a lot of debris.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>Bottas went with huge aggression</i>
<i>into the first corner,</i>
<i>taking it to Hamilton,</i>
<i>making him feel uncomfortable,</i>
<i>like Rosberg did in 2016.</i>
<i>But Lewis still managed</i>
<i>to hold it beautifully.</i>
[Bono] <i>So lights are out.</i>
<i>You control the pace.</i>
[Lewis] Very poor grip there.
[commentator 1]
<i>A lot can happen with Hamilton.</i>
<i>He's still under investigation</i>
<i>for that practice start.</i>
-[Angela] What is it?
-Look.
[Angela] Oh God.
[commentator 1]
<i>There is a ten-second time penalty</i>
<i>for the race leader, Lewis Hamilton,</i>
<i>for practice start violations.</i>
[Toto] Fuck! Is Lewis aware?
Tell him. Tell him.
{\an8}[Bono] <i>Lewis,</i>
<i>we have a ten-second time penalty</i>
{\an8}<i>for the practice start infringements.</i>
{\an8}[Lewis] What happened?
{\an8}Sorry, the practice start,
{\an8}going to the grid,
got a ten-second penalty.
-[Lewis] Where's that in the rule book?
-[Bono] Copy, Lewis.
[Lewis] Yeah, that's bullshit.
[Vowles] Yeah, it's… It's shit.
{\an8}[Dom] <i>So Lewis ahead</i>
<i>has a ten-second penalty</i>
-Start closing up the gap to Lewis.
-[Bottas] Copy.
[commentator 1] <i>Bottas has got</i>
<i>a second chance to win the Grand Prix.</i>
[Vowles]
Simon, talk to me about vibration.
-It's still growing steadily lap on lap.
-[Bono] I'm gonna call Lewis.
[Ron] We need to get him in
as soon as we can.
[Ron] <i>Stand by, red. Tires off.</i>
[Bono] Box, box. Box, box.
[commentator 2] <i>The Mercedes garage</i>
<i>are getting ready for Hamilton's pit stop.</i>
[Lewis] Tires are still okay.
Do not stop me early. Do not.
-[Bono] OK, copy, Lewis.
-Stand down, gents. Stand down.
[commentator 3]
<i>Hamilton doesn't want to come in.</i>
[Toto] Tell him, "Attack all you can."
[Bono] <i>Lewis, let's give it everything.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton does not pit</i>
<i>and he's still got great pace.</i>
<i>A full second quicker than his last</i>
<i>flying lap. He's on the march.</i>
<i>Six tenths quicker than Bottas.</i>
<i>Over a second quicker than Verstappen.</i>
[Bono] <i>Lewis, that's the fastest lap.</i>
<i>You need to maintain this pace.</i>
-[Toto] Safety critical vibrations.
-[Vowles] We have to stop Lewis this lap.
[Ron] <i>Blankets off in the pit lane now.</i>
[Bono] <i>Sorry, Lewis,</i>
<i>you need to box. Box, box.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Into the pits comes Lewis Hamilton.</i>
<i>This will be a ten-second wait,</i>
<i>which will feel like it's forever for him.</i>
[Lewis] Why did we have to serve it?
Why isn't it added at the end of the race?
[Bono] Yeah, Lewis, we have to serve it.
Just focus.
Lewis is serving his ten-second penalty.
Now show us your pace.
{\an8}Copy.
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton is gonna come out</i>
<i>of the pits in the middle of the pack.</i>
[Lewis] This is just ridiculous.
How far have I dropped back?
[Bono] Currently down to P11.
[commentator 1]
<i>That record-equaling 91st win</i>
<i>will take a lot of effort from Hamilton</i>
<i>if he's gonna achieve it.</i>
<i>He's coming out behind Sebastian Vettel.</i>
<i>-</i>[Bottas] <i>Where's Lewis?</i>
<i>-</i>[Dom] Lewis, currently P11.
[commentator 1]
<i>This is now critical for the race.</i>
<i>What can Valtteri Bottas do now that</i>
<i>he's got a clear track in front of him?</i>
Good job. This pace is very good.
[Bottas]
The penalty for Lewis, it's welcome.
[chuckles]
It only helps me.
And I decided that there's no way
I'm gonna give up this win.
[commentator 2] <i>If Valtteri doesn't</i>
<i>win now… This is on a plate for Bottas.</i>
{\an8}-Why did you stop me so early?
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>We'll have that chat later.</i>
<i>We have Vettel ahead.</i>
<i>Let's get on with it.</i>
{\an8}[Adami] <i>Hamilton, 0.4 behind.</i>

{\an8}-[Dom] <i>That's the fastest lap.</i>
-Yeah.
Valtteri now has fastest lap.
I don't want to hear from you now, Bono.
It doesn't make any difference.
[commentator 2] <i>There will be</i>
<i>another podium for Lewis Hamilton,</i>
<i>but it will not be that 91st win.</i>
<i>Valtteri Bottas</i>

Let's show our appreciation
to a fantastic drive from him.
[commentator 1] <i>Bottas takes victory,</i>

{\an8}Yes! [laughs]
<i>Fuck yeah!</i>
Yes, mate! Get in there!
[commentator 1] <i>Win number nine</i>

-[man 1] Lewis is not happy, is he?
-[man 2] No.
-[Marko] Good decision.
-[Horner] The right decision, 100%.
For sure, he will do something again.
He believes he can do whatever he wants.
[reporter] Were you not aware
of that regulation?
[Lewis] I've done it at a million tracks,
never been questioned on it.
They're trying to stop me, aren't they?
So it is what it is.
I mean, that penalty was very drastic,
very radical,
very over-the-top.
[Toto] This is ridiculous.
Ron and I are going to the stewards.
Just to make a point. We owe it to Lewis.
I don't want to just accept this.
[Lewis] I've had a target on my back,
since I started racing.
You know, I was that kid
that everyone wanted to beat.
And they couldn't beat me,
so they would find other ways to beat me.
{\an8}[Ennser]
It was extremely dangerous to do that.
{\an8}[Toto] It's not the first time
somebody did a race start
from a place
that was different to the other ones.
[Ennser]
It was not an easy decision, honestly.
Toto, we do not look at who he is.
We look at the regulations and we apply…
[Toto] OK, gentlemen.
Stubborn.
It is just talking against a wall.
[announcer] <i>Now, please welcome</i>
<i>the third-placed driver today,</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton!</i>
[Toto] Most important is that
we defend Lewis. That's why, in that case,
podium is less important
than seeing the stewards immediately
and making our argument.
And I think Valtteri himself doesn't care
whether he's being given credit or not.
[announcer] <i>Valtteri Bottas of Finland!</i>
[crowd cheering]
Beating Lewis,
you know, it is so satisfying.
Everyone was expecting Lewis
to match Michael in the race wins,
but I want to delay that process
as far as possible.
-[woman] See you, Toto.
-See ya.
-[man 1] Happy?
-Yeah, happy.
We need to be happy for a one and three.
It's not a compete misery.
See ya.
[chiming]
[man 2] We'll do the team victory
in ten minutes, okay?
Feels good.
-Yeah.
-[Bottas] It feels good.
Look at this. The engineers are gone, so…
Every single driver
would do anything to get into my seat.
But it's not easy sometimes,
or most of the time,
when you are against Lewis.
It takes a lot of energy.
Traditions.
There's a reason
why Lewis is in this team, but,
you know, there must be also a reason
why I am in this team.
I hate to be second.
I'm not just the number two.
{\an8}[Leclerc] The car is so hard to drive.
{\an8}[commentator] <i>Oh, big one!</i>
They had an unfair advantage
that the FIA took away.
We are in this position
because we deserve to be.
I guess he was pissed off.
{\an8}[commentator] <i>That Racing Point,</i>
<i>an awful lot of pace.</i>
{\an8}Racing Point, I don't understand.
Our competitors
simply didn't do a good enough job.
{\an8}You always think about your future.
I want to do the maximum.
{\an8}I don't want to have any regret.
[Leclerc] Fuck, fuck, fuck! Is he okay?
[dramatic music playing]that I will race
in this year's Italian Grand Prix.
The best feature about this helmet
for this weekend
is that I will be able to take my mask off
as soon as I'm wearing the helmet.
-That's it.
-[man] Okay.
We cannot be too funny
considering the performance after Belgium.
-[Vettel] Says who?
-We. Because… [chuckles]
[Vettel] I think you should be funny
if you look at our performance.
So, is that the credo for this weekend,
"Don't laugh"?
-[Roeske] No! [chuckles]
-[Vettel] No jokes?
[Roeske speaks Italian]
[upbeat music playing]
[Buxton] Enzo Ferrari said,
{\an8}"Ask a child to draw a car
and they'll color it red."
{\an8}I think
that's all you need to know about Ferrari.
It's everyone's understanding
of what a racing car is.
{\an8}Formula 1 is synonymous with Ferrari.
{\an8}-[cheering]
-They're the oldest-standing team.
{\an8}Arguably one of the biggest brands
in the world.
They're the most iconic team in Formula 1.
[indistinct shouting]
{\an8}A lot of drivers' dream is
to drive for Ferrari.
[commentator 1]
<i>Seven World Championship titles.</i>
[cheering]
[Horner] Ferrari enjoys a status
that no other team holds.
They use that to its strength.
{\an8}[crunching, clattering]
{\an8}[Vettel] Not again!
[Horner] But sometimes it bites them.
[Leclerc] Ah, it's so frustrating!
[Otmar] We are outperforming Ferrari.
{\an8}[Leclerc] Oh, come on!
{\an8}They aren't as competitive
as they normally are.
[commentator 2]
<i>Ferrari have Leclerc 13th,</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel 14th.</i>
{\an8}[Vettel] I'll hang in there,
but you know that you've messed up.
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>The Ferrari engine power</i>
<i>is just not there.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 4]
<i>Charles Leclerc absolutely plumb last.</i>
{\an8}[Gow] The feeling of Ferrari right now
{\an8}is one of huge question marks.
[commentator 3] <i>What a miserable season.</i>
[Gow] Will they ever regain
the form of old?
[Claire] I know what it feels like
to be running a team
when you're in the shit.
{\an8}But I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy.
[Leclerc] It's going to be a disaster.
[producer] Um, can we talk a little bit
about the season so far?
It's been pretty difficult, right?
Um…
{\an8}Why?
{\an8}We don't have that much time
and, uh, yeah, to be honest…
Next question! [chuckles]
[engine revving, tires squealing]
[upbeat music playing]
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>It's a very speedy hello</i>
<i>from the fastest circuit of them all.</i>
<i>We're here in Monza</i>
<i>for round eight of the Formula 1</i>
<i>World Championship in 2020.</i>
<i>It is the Italian Grand Prix.</i>
[Buxton] <i>Grazie.</i>
[Grosjean] Netflix again? Oh my God.
[Perez] From where do you fly? LA?
[Steiner] No, I fly JFK.
I fly Charlotte, JFK, JFK, London.
[Perez] I come private if you want a lift?
-Where do you leave from?
-Guadalajara.
[Vettel] Their rooms
can't be smaller than ours. [chuckles]
[Binotto] Ferrari had bad seasons
in the past, as well as this year.
{\an8}Yes, we are in a difficult moment,
but Monza is a very historic Grand Prix.
Obviously, being in Italy,
it's, uh, the one which counts.
-[in Italian] Is everything okay?
-[Hoffer] Yes, fine.
[in English] Let me say,
you may lose a season,
but if you are winning Monza,
at least you have saved your season.
[Hoffer in Italian] I am going to read out
some of the media questions.
-[Binotto] Yes.
-[Hoffer] This is a question from Vanzini.
What is the key word right now?
[Binotto] What do you suggest?
[Hoffer] Well, the same as always.
[Binotto]
No, I think determination is better.
[Hoffer] Yes, I would say
we have a lot of determination.
-More than usual.
-[Binotto] Yes.
[in English] Certainly, we understand
that it's a very difficult moment,
but I think
that the frustrations we've got, um,
we need to transform that
into determination.
-[Buxton] Ciao.
-[Binotto] <i>Buongiorno.</i>
[Buxton] <i>Buongiorno. </i>A difficult weekend
for you to arrive back here in Italy.
How do you keep the expectations realistic
for this weekend?
[Binotto] Uh, certainly, uh,
we know what we need to improve.
I think there is no doubt.
What's important is to stay focused
and really to try to work very hard
and to transform any frustration
into determination.
[Gow] You feel for Ferrari,
going into their homeland
with nothing to show.
They have to try and find some redemption.
They have to find something
to pin this season on.
[Adami] Do you think
it will be a bit like last year?
[Gow] Hopefully,
it's got as bad as it's gonna get.
[Vettel] I think it will be a mess.
{\an8}[both speaking Italian]
{\an8}-[Hoffer in English] Looking good?
-[man] As always.
[Hoffer chuckles]
[Hoffer] Uh, can you just
turn upside down your mask?
This is not to be filmed,
but you got "Ferrari" upside down,
which is okay,
but maybe at best to put it…
-There you are.
-That's better?
-[Leclerc] The filter.
-[Hoffer] Yeah, the filter needs to be…
They are tricky.
[Leclerc grunts]
[Hoffer] Okay, now, first of all,
welcome, everybody, to Italy.
Uh, now, first point,
please wear your mask all the time.
As usual, this is really important.
[Vettel] Mask? No mask?
My name is Sebastian Vettel,
racing for Scuderia Ferrari.
[producer] No mask.
[Vettel] Wow.
Brave.
No mask.
[Hoffer] Don't look at your mobile
during media activity.
I'm telling you this
because the media have come up to us
saying, "Don't do it,
you know, it doesn't look good,"
so just be focused on what you're doing
and please don't look at your mobile.
[Leclerc] That's four post-races
that I'm not speaking at all.
I'm watching the phone,
but don't have any questions.
[Hoffer] I know, but it doesn't look good.
[Leclerc] Hi, I'm Charles Leclerc,
driving for Scuderia Ferrari.
Um, I have a contract
until 2024 with the team
{\an8}and I started in Formula 1 two years ago.
{\an8}[Hoffer] Even if you're not talking,
you should show interest
in what Sebastian is saying, so, just…
-[team laughs]
-[Leclerc] I am showing interest.
But he is repeating, uh, the same…
It's always the same question,
so I know the answer.
[Hoffer] Okay, okay, but still.
[Vettel] Wait another ten years,
then you'll see.
[team laughs]
[Vettel] There's no hope for you on this.
[Hoffer chuckles] Okay.
Uh, now, the first point, Charles…
[Binotto] I think that Seb is
a very experienced
four-times world champion,
but I think even for Seb,
it's always a continuous learning process.
[machinery whirring]
[Binotto] Charles is very young.
He is very fast.
He is very consistent.
He is good in battling,
defending, attacking.
So, in order to develop our team
for this season,
there is not a number-one driver
in Ferrari.
[Leclerc] Hello.
[Vettel] Hello.
<i>Morning, Charles and Seb.</i>
<i>How are you guys?</i>
[Leclerc] Good, thank you.
<i>Right, let's get cracking.</i>
<i>We've got some brilliant fans here</i>
<i>who, uh, are dying to…</i>
[interference distorts voice]
-[Vettel chuckles] Hello.
<i>-</i>[Hoffer] The connection has gone.
-[woman] Really?
-[Hoffer] Yes.
Uh, cut Zoom.
-Go out, okay? Go out of Zoom.
-[Leclerc] The problem is the connection.
-[Hoffer] But to make this work.
-[Vettel] It's coming.
[Zoom call chimes]
<i>-</i>[interviewer] <i>Hello!</i>
-[Vettel] Is it better?
[interviewer] <i>Yes. For now, it looks good.</i>
[Vettel] It's a difficult year
for Ferrari.
Not just on track, also off track.
[interviewer] <i>Amazing modern technology.</i>
<i>Okay, Esther, go again.</i>
<i>What was your question?</i>
[Esther] <i>Okay, so, Charles,</i>
<i>when will you launch</i>
<i>your clothing collection?</i>
Oh! Uh, well, at the end,
for now, it's on standby.
Uh, it's something I really wanted to do
and it's something that I think
I will keep in mind for the future.
-[Vettel] What's the collection?
-It was like full clothing.
-Like, a full collection.
-Ah. He's not allowed.
-That's why it's not happening.
-[all laugh]
'Cause we have a… We have a partner.
So, he was told off.
I… I… I'm not supposed to say that,
but I'm leaving at the end of the year,
so I can say what I want,
you know? [chuckles]
[notification chirps]
{\an8}[Vettel] It is clear that I will not be
a part of this team beyond this year.
I was surprised when I got the call
that the team does not want to continue.
[notifications chirping]
{\an8}[Binotto] Seb has been with us
a few years already.
I think we all love Seb
because he's part of our family,
but, uh, we felt the necessity to,
to look ahead, to look forward.
It's like trying to create foundations
for our long-term future.
[Gow] For Ferrari to announce so publicly
that Sebastian Vettel's leaving the team,
I think, is a clear state of intention
of what they want for the future.
Charles Leclerc.
That's a pretty toxic environment
for a man
who's a four-times world champion.
[producer] Would it make you insecure?
For sure, it's tough.
Obviously, I care a lot about the sport.
It's a big part of my life
and therefore, you know,
I asked myself a lot of questions
about what I want to do in the future.
I think
that Sebastian
was left very hurt
by the way in which his departure
from the team came about.
The fact that the negotiations
hadn't been anywhere near as lengthy,
shall we say,
as we'd been led to believe.
[Binotto] I heard
that telling him so early
would have created a lot of difficulties.
But I think whatever were the concerns
people were raising
were the wrong concerns.
[crowd chanting] Ferrari!
Ferrari! Ferrari!
-Ferrari! Ferrari!
-[scattered applause]
Ferrari is just special.
It has always been special for me.
[upbeat music playing]
[fan 1] Go on, Charles!
Go on, Charles!
[Leclerc] From being a child,
I was always looking at the red car,
and, uh, it has always been a dream
to be a driver for, for them.
-[in Italian] Hey, guys.
-[fan 2] Thank you, Charles.
[fan 3] You're number one, bro!
[in English] Over winter, Ferrari gave
Charles Leclerc a contract extension,
the likes of which had never been seen.
[fan 4 in Italian] Go on, you're the best!
[Buxton in English] Not even Schumacher
got a five-year contract extension
and Charles did,
which shows just how important
Charles had become to their future.
[Leclerc sighs]
-[man in Italian] Did you sleep well?
-[Leclerc in Spanish] Very well.
-[woman chuckles]
-[engine revving]
[in English] Well, it still feels amazing
to know that, um,
I have the longest contract
in the history of Scuderia Ferrari
and to know that we will be working
for such a long time
and to be building
something special together.
[fan 5 in Italian] Go on Charles, Ferrari!
[Leclerc] Hello, thank you.
[fan 6] Go on, you're the best!
[fan 7] Kick his ass!
[Leclerc] Hi, guys. Thanks.
[crowd yelling, whistling]
Hello. Hi. I'm sorry.
-[man] Let's see what today has in store.
-[Claire] Let's see.
[commentator 1] <i>Now,</i>
<i>from the Temple of Speed,</i>
<i>Monza's national autodrome,</i>
<i>it's time for Qualifying</i>
<i>with 20 of the best drivers in the world.</i>
<i>Today, Red Bull hope to interrupt</i>
<i>an endless stream of pole positions</i>
<i>for the German team.</i>
<i>And Ferrari are simply hoping somehow</i>
<i>to find their way into the top ten.</i>
[machinery whirring]
[suspenseful music playing]
Expectations are difficult to have
this season
because it's unpredictable, the results,
but it is a very special race for us,
so, uh, we have to do well.
But yeah, it's not going to be easy.
[machinery whirring]
[Vettel] Morale is tough, obviously.
The team is certainly not on a high.
{\an8}But I think everybody's trying
to do their most
to make sure
that we still get the best out of the car.
[engines revving]
[Buxton] Qualifying's important.
It determines
your starting position on the grid.
[cars zooming]
The fewer people that start ahead of you,
the fewer people you've got to overtake
to win on Sunday.
{\an8}[Leclerc] Don't send me
in too much traffic.
{\an8}[Padros] <i>Copy.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 2]
<i>This is the two Ferrari cars</i>.
{\an8}[Leclerc] Seb overtook me.
{\an8}I don't understand
why I went out in front of him.
[commentator 2] <i>Was he not meant</i>
<i>to overtake Charles?</i>
<i>Was Charles meant to be ahead of him?</i>
<i>Have Ferrari got things</i>
<i>a little bit mixed up?</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>All happy families down at Ferrari.</i>
[engineer] Mode charge. Mode charge.
Track is clear behind.
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>There's a pressure</i>
<i>on Charles Leclerc's shoulders,</i>
{\an8}<i>the man, of course,</i>
<i>who was on pole position here last year.</i>
[thrilling music playing]
-[Leclerc] The car is so hard to drive.
-[Padros] Copy. Understood.
[Gene in Italian]
We aren't doing well on the long runs.
[Leclerc in English] So difficult.
[Gene] Ah, fuck's sake.
[engineer] At the moment, you are P11.
[Leclerc] We are so slow.
[commentator 1]
<i>There's nothing Leclerc can do.</i>
<i>He doesn't have enough prancing horses</i>
<i>down the front straight.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Charles Leclerc across the line.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Only 13th on the grid.</i>
[commentator 4]
<i>Thirteen, unlucky for some.</i>
[Leclerc] Best I can do.
The best I can do.
[commentator 4] <i>The real concern is</i>
<i>that's their true pace.</i>
[engine revving]
{\an8}[Vettel] Any cars around me?
[Adami] No, we are in a good slot.
Hamilton 3.3 in front.
Constant speed 200.
[man in Italian] There was a chance
to do better here.
[Adami in English] <i>For info,</i>
<i>there's a big traffic jam out there.</i>
[Vettel groans]
Let's talk about it after.
[commentator 3] <i>Look. This is the kind</i>
<i>of traffic we were hoping they'd avoid.</i>
[Adami] <i>If you need</i>
<i>to overtake people, we will.</i>
[man in Italian] A similar queue to that
you had on your way back from holiday.
[commentator 3] <i>Vettel can't fight back.</i>
<i>The Ferrari engine power isn't there.</i>
[Vettel] Is there a gap I can get through?
[in Italian] Too much traffic.
[engine revving]
[Adami] <i>It will be mode push</i>
<i>for last corner. Mode push.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>What is going on out there</i>
<i>on this Saturday afternoon?</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel,</i>
<i>he's in the bottom five at the moment,</i>
<i>crosses the line in a few moments,</i>
<i>Sebastian Vettel.</i>
<i>Uh, we see Vettel pitting.</i>
<i>He's pitted.</i>
<i>He's not going to improve his time.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Ferrari just weren't ready.</i>
<i>What has happened to them this year?</i>
[Vettel] Shit. What a mess.
[commentator 2]
<i>And the big headline news here at Monza</i>
<i>is that Sebastian Vettel</i>
<i>is knocked out in qualifying.</i>
<i>It's Ferrari, P17.</i>
-[Vettel] I guess that's it.
-[Adami] <i>Yeah, it is. P17.</i>
[cars zooming past]
[cars zooming past]
[commentator 3] <i>Not quite the Ferrari</i>
<i>of old here in Monza, is it?</i>
<i>Thirteenth and 17th on the grid.</i>
<i>Ferrari's worst fears in qualifying</i>
<i>have been confirmed.</i>
[somber music playing]
[reporter 1] How frustrating is it that
you win from pole position here last year
and then down to this position?
That must be heavy for you.
[Leclerc] Yeah. I mean, it's tough
because once you do a good lap
and then you do P13, it doesn't feel good,
and, uh, yeah, I mean,
it hurts even more once it's at home,
but it's a reality at the moment
for us, unfortunately.
[reporter 2]
Seb, you didn't finish your second run.
[Vettel] No.
I was in the middle of the mess,
so there was no point to do it.
Yeah. [clicks tongue]
That's what it was, a very short day.
You can call it frustration,
but at the end of the day,
on power, we are probably worse off
than we were last year
and the unsatisfying,
most unsatisfying bit
is that you didn't get
to prove to yourself,
"Okay, what could I do today?"
You know, how close to the top
or how far up could I have gone?
[indistinct chattering in French]
-[Leclerc] The pole's above your head.
-[Vasseur] What?
{\an8}[Leclerc] You have a mic above your head.
{\an8}But yeah, it's not easy.
{\an8}I don't know how it will be tomorrow.
-[Vasseur] Well, yeah, look at Vettel.
-[Leclerc] Yeah.
[Vasseur] He didn't do the last lap.
It's okay, they can't read our lips.
[all snicker]
[Leclerc] No, but be careful,
you have a mic above your head.
[Vasseur chuckles]
[Binotto in English]
We missed many opportunities.
Certainly the pressure was there.
Obviously, the car is not as good
as we would have wished.
I think Seb's got
some difficulties with the car.
Lack of confidence.
And Charles' car was not performing.
No grip, so, you know, difficult
to really be fast around the lap.
So, we had a poor quali, very poor.
It's a tough time for Ferrari.
There's been a lot of mudslinging,
a lot of accusations
regarding the "secret settlement."
I was wondering how you cope with that?
[Binotto] Honestly, I think
there is a lot of bullshit around it.
-[reporter] Yeah.
-[Binotto] A lot of rumors.
It's very simple. There have been never
a breach of regulations.
[tense music playing]
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Leclerc's on the inside,</i>
<i>Hamilton goes onto the gravel,</i>
{\an8}<i>and you can hear the cheers from Monza.</i>
{\an8}<i>The Ferrari fans loved it.</i>
Ferrari came out of the break last year
firing on all cylinders.
[commentator 1] <i>Charles Leclerc won</i>
<i>in Spa. He wins in Monza.</i>
They basically built a car
with a rocket ship in the back of it.
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Ferrari coming on strong</i>
<i>in the second part of this season.</i>
{\an8}[Gow] They were going so fast
that nobody could quite believe it.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Vettel is going for it.</i>
<i>The Ferrari's speed is giving Hamilton</i>
<i>a lot to think about.</i>
[fireworks banging]
[cheering]
[commentator 2]
<i>Ferrari have won three races in a row.</i>
{\an8}Well, we highlighted certain things
to the FIA, together with Mercedes,
{\an8}that… that we felt
that they should be looking at.
[Gow] The other teams couldn't work out
exactly how or what,
but they knew something was up.
All of a sudden, in Austin,
we got rumblings of a technical directive
all about fuel flow coming from the FIA,
which is basically a rule clarification,
that says you can, you cannot do this.
{\an8}[commentator 3]
<i>I tell you who's on their back foot,</i>
{\an8}<i>you've got to say Charles Leclerc,</i>
<i>just trying to get a handle on this car.</i>
[Padros] <i>Let me know</i>
<i>if you can faster, question.</i>
[Leclerc] I don't think I can.
And then no power.
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Vettel can barely keep up,</i>
<i>he's so slow down the straight.</i>
[cars zooming]
[reporter 1] How was that?
Shit. Uh, that's how I call that.
I really don't know what happened.
I think there was really something weird.
[anchor] <i>Ferrari is coming under fire</i>
<i>because allegedly, they have been</i>
<i>gaining an advantage with their engine.</i>
<i>The other teams are not happy about it.</i>
{\an8}<i>They did conduct an investigation,</i>
<i>came to a conclusion,</i>
{\an8}<i>reached a settlement with Ferrari,</i>
<i>but aren't disclosing the details of that.</i>
[Horner] We were surprised
at the statement from the FIA.
We're pushing for full disclosure of that.
[reporter 2]
The FIA haven't found the team guilty
of any specific wrongdoing.
Are you disappointed then
that they didn't clear the team?
[Vettel] I trust my team
to do the right things
and we trust the FIA to do their job.
[Leclerc] I fully trust my team
uh, and I trust the FIA
for making sure everything was okay,
so for me, yes, it's, uh, it's done,
and now I look to the future.
[camera shutters clicking]
{\an8}[Zak] They don't have the power
that they had before, that's clear,
{\an8}and they don't seem
to be in a happy place at the moment.
{\an8}[Otmar] From the outside,
not knowing why the deal was secret,
{\an8}it looks like Ferrari had
an unfair advantage
{\an8}that the FIA took away.
[Steiner] People say,
"Why you don't change engine supplier?"
I think that is not what I call reality.
Going forward,
we are staying with Ferrari,
even if, in the moment it isn't…
{\an8}I mean, uh, uh… easy
They helped us a lot in the beginning,
so now, we need to help them
and be loyal and...
and a little bit patient.
[Horner] When you look
at the relative performance
from last year to this year,
I think it's self-explanatory.
[producer] Some team principals
have suggested
that the 2019 car or engine wasn't legal.
Honestly,
I don't think there is much to add.
The point is closed.

<i>This is a beautiful day in Monza</i>
<i>as we prepare for round eight</i>

{\an8}I'm having a romantic conversation
with my girlfriend. You can't record this.
[commentator 2]
<i>You have to go back to 1984</i>
<i>as the last time two Ferraris</i>
<i>started outside the top ten</i>
<i>at their home Grand Prix.</i>
[reporter 1] Test Vettel mic.
Test, one, two.
[Buxton] I want to see how far I can dig.
-[man] Yeah. Okay, cool.
-[Buxton] See what we get.
2020, for Sebastian and Ferrari,
it just hasn't quite clicked,
it hasn't quite meshed.
[Hoffer] Okay. Okay.
We can see you now. <i>Perfetto.</i>
[Buxton] There is no way
that a Ferrari should be 17th...
[Hoffer] They are coming from there.
They are just there now,
so if you want to film them…
[Buxton] …or that Sebastian Vettel is…
that far off.
Seb's a four-time world champion
and one of the most ruthless,
brilliantly effective racing drivers
that I've ever seen.
How are you?
-[Vettel] Good.
-[Buxton] Good. Good.
You don't lose that ability overnight.
Seb, um, I think
you're a very morally guided person.
I think you have a good heart
and a good direction.
Well, I think you have to
have your principles, so I think, uh,
yes, as much as I want to succeed
and I want myself to have success
rather than others,
I play by certain rules.
And, you know,
one of those rules are I have to be fair,
and if being successful
means that I have to break these rules,
then it wouldn't feel right.
It's like cheating, in the end,
and you are cheating yourself, so…
[Buxton] Do you think everyone
plays to the same rules that you do?
[Vettel clicks tongue] I can't answer.
[tense music playing]
[Horner] Take control of it yourself.
-Should be your decision.
-[Vettel] Yeah.
-[Horner] You know?
-[Vettel] It is.
-[Horner] You're still young enough.
-[Vettel] Yeah.
[producer] Seb leaving Ferrari,
what's going on there?
[Horner] Just take a moment to pause.
-[Vettel] And then come home.
-[Horner] Exactly. All right.
See you later.
Yeah, it's, I'm sure,
a question that you'll be asking him.
[Gow] Sebastian Vettel is out of a seat.
He has nowhere to go.
Up and down the paddock,
everybody was trying to work out
what was he gonna do.
Would he leave Formula 1?
Would he find another team?
[Toto] Sebastian is
a great personality who, uh,
shaped the last ten years in Formula 1.
{\an8}Simply the fact that Sebastian's available
is worth the discussion.
[suspenseful music playing]
[Otmar] Frankly,
I'm good friends with Seb.
I knew him
from before he was a Formula 1 driver
and, uh, for a very long time.
He's still a young man and very talented.
It'd be, uh, a shame
not to see him on the grid next season.
[Horner] I remember Sebastian Vettel,
when he was driving for us,
came from more than 40 points behind
to beat Fernando Alonso
to the 2012 World Championship.
We don't write anything off.
Literally anything can happen.
[machinery whirring, grinding]
[in Italian] Let's hope
he doesn't lose motivation.
Yes, we need to keep him focused.
[Binotto in English] As a team principal,
my challenge certainly is
make sure that the external comments
are not affecting the morale of the team.
[machinery whirring]
[Binotto] It was a very difficult quali.
Uh, I understand...
the disappointment of the people around,
but more important to stay focused.
[cars zooming past]
[Vettel] Okay. Back of the grid.
[Adami] <i>And radio check.</i>
[Vettel] Yeah. One, two, radio check okay.
Ah, it's not the first time
I started at the back of the grid.
I believe that there's always a chance.
Sunday, when you stand on the grid,
even if you're not in a great position,
you never know what happens.
If you are racing in P10
and the nine cars in front of you retire,
you win the race.
[machinery whirring]
[Zak] Ferrari's not so good
in the straight.
-[Horner chuckles] Unbelievable!
-Fucking hell.
[Jock] <i>And radio check, Charles.</i>
[Leclerc] To be honest,
I think it would be a mistake
for me to put extra pressure
because I'm driving for Ferrari.
[Jock] <i>Radio check. Can you hear me?</i>
What I have to do in this situation
is to try and maximize what I have.
[Leclerc] Radio check.
Whoa. Wasn't plugged in.
[Jock] <i>No problem.</i>
[Leclerc] When I close the visor,
I try to extract all of those thoughts
to be 100% focused on the goal.
[suspenseful music playing]
[engine revving]
[Binotto] I think emotion was going up.
The pressure was there.
No doubt.
Because we knew
that Monza was important for us.
[commentator 3] <i>And we're underway</i>
<i>for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.</i>
<i>Great getaway for Lewis Hamilton.</i>
<i>Up to second place goes Carlos Sainz.</i>
<i>Bottas down to third.</i>
{\an8}<i>Charles Leclerc is losing a position</i>

[Padros] You are P13. P13.

<i>Hamilton's lead is three seconds</i>

{\an8}<i>Here's Vettel.</i>

[Russell] Yeah, copy.

<i>on the left-hand side of the brakes.</i>
<i>Rear left.</i>
Russell, 0.5 behind.
[crew member in Italian] Distance!
[commentator 3] <i>Here comes George Russell.</i>
[Russell] <i>Vett has smoking from behind.</i>
<i>I'm not sure if he's dropping oil.</i>
-[Vettel] Something wrong, the rear left.
-[Adami] <i>Copy.</i>
<i>You need to cool down the rears</i>
<i>if you can.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>They've got a problem with the car.</i>
<i>They've got Russell</i>

<i>Vettel can't slow it down!</i>
[Vettel] Brakes failed. The brakes failed.
Brakes failed.
[crew member 2 in Italian] Oh God!
[commentator 3 in English] <i>Brake fire.</i>
<i>The brakes are on fire.</i>
[Vettel] No more brake pedal.
Brake line exploded.
I can bring the car back if you want.
[in Italian] We're always in the middle
of any crisis.
[commentator 3 in English]
<i>End of the day for Vettel,</i>
<i>who's leaving Ferrari</i>
<i>at the end of the season.</i>
<i>His last race as a Ferrari driver at Monza</i>
<i>and he's out on lap eight of 53.</i>
<i>A torturous Italian Grand Prix</i>
<i>for the Scuderia.</i>
<i>They'll hope this is as bad as it's going</i>
<i>to be for them at their home ground.</i>
[Binotto] For Seb,
it has been certainly frustrating.
It's the most important race of the season
and I think that
whoever is a Ferrari driver,
the dream is to win in Monza.
[commentator 2] <i>And it is lap 24</i>
<i>of this Italian Grand Prix.</i>
{\an8}[Leclerc] Ferrari is passion
and you can feel it.
It's just unbelievable
and you don't get that
anywhere else on the grid.
[Padros] <i>Gap to Räikkönen in front, 0.6.</i>
Copy.
It's our job now
to get back to, uh, to winning.
[commentator 2]
<i>Leclerc's putting Räikkönen under pressure</i>
<i>behind Antonio Giovinazzi</i>
<i>He's got past Räikkönen.</i>
<i>He might clear two Alfas</i>
<i>in about 300 meters here.</i>
<i>And he does!</i>
<i>Charles Leclerc picks off Räikkönen</i>
<i>and picks off Giovinazzi as well.</i>
[crew member 3 in Italian] <i>Fantastico!</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Leclerc may have lost speed.</i>
<i>He hasn't lost any bravery</i>
<i>and commitment, has he?</i>
[Leclerc] Confidence in Formula 1,
I think, is everything
because if you are not confident
in your car or your abilities,
then you are going to struggle.
[Padros] We need to close the gap.
We need to close the gap now.
We are not where we expected to be.
We are not where we want to be.
[Padros] <i>Try to maximize full throttle.</i>
[Leclerc] I'm…
I'm struggling, guys.
But still, my goal is the same,
to try to put the car on its limit.
[engine whining]
[Padros] <i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>Charles? Can you hear me?</i>
[Leclerc] Ah…
Fuck!
It was very extreme.
I can remember everything
apart from the hit itself.
I think there's a bit of a blackout
for a few seconds.
The hit was pretty hard.
Everything happened,
uh, very, very quickly
and then, unfortunately,
puts all our hopes to the bin.
I'm sorry, but I…
Honestly, I struggled so much
with the balance.
Fuck!
Sorry.
[Padros] Copy.
Main thing is that you're okay.
And go to P0, please, P0.
[commentator 3]
<i>Leclerc hauls himself out of the car.</i>
<i>It was a long way through the corner</i>
<i>for that to be a brake problem</i>
<i>like Vettel's.</i>
<i>Let's see what did happen.</i>
<i>He's on his own</i>
<i>coming into the Parabolica.</i>
<i>And he just lost it on the power</i>
<i>on the hard tires,</i>
<i>and driver error.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>What a horrible, horrible</i>
<i>Italian Grand Prix for the Scuderia.</i>
[helicopter blades whirring]
[Buxton] How bad a result
was this for Ferrari?
It was one of the most horrible weekends
they've had in a very long time.
[Gow] It's a huge fall from grace
for Ferrari
because this is a team
that should be fighting Mercedes
and yet, they cannot compete with anybody.
It was a difficult weekend
which concluded even in the worst way.
Obviously,
we are all unhappy and disappointed.
[Vettel] It's poor, obviously,
where we are,
especially here, for our home race.
It's probably a blessing
there's nobody in the stand.
[Binotto] We are very united.
I don't think
there are even tensions inside the team.
[Vettel] There are no shortcuts in life.
We are in this position
because we probably deserve to be.
[Binotto] I think
that I can feel the team behind me.
Very committed.
Now, it's down to us to…
to prove that we are capable.
[classical opera music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome</i>
<i>to the second Italian race of the season</i>
<i>and a milestone in motor racing.</i>
[crew member yells]
[commentator 1]
<i>Ferrari's 1000th Grand Prix.</i>
<i>And they're preparing</i>
<i>to celebrate in style.</i>
[Binotto] Ferrari has been always there
since the very start.
Never stopping since 1950
when the F1 started.
I think whatever difficulties
we've got at the moment,
it's important to celebrate
because we are celebrating
an entire history
and a fantastic milestone.
And if you've got such a history,
somehow you are special.
[Gow] This is Ferrari's 1000th race.
The party, the displays.
They are a huge, huge corporation,
making millions of pounds.
This is the time to shine.
[notification chirps]
[Buxton] <i>As the sun rises</i>
<i>on a beautiful Tuscan morning,</i>
<i>news that Sebastian Vettel</i>
<i>has signed for Aston Martin.</i>
Seb, we understand you didn't even
put pen to paper until last night.
[reporters shout questions]
[Vettel] For me, it was important
that I sign up for something I believe in.
Today, it's been announced
that I'll have a seat,
I'll be on the grid next year.
I'm looking forward to a new challenge.
[reporters shout questions]
[Vettel] I'm a competitor,
so if I wasn't convinced
that I can be competitive
with Aston Martin,
I think, uh, you know,
life is treating me far too good
uh, to drag on and to keep suffering.
-[Hoffer] Bonjour.
-[indistinct chattering in background]
[Hoffer] Okay, well, of course,
the big news we all know now
that Sebastian has a seat and a team
for next year and beyond.
[Leclerc] And beyond?
[Vettel mumbles indistinctly]
-[Hoffer] Big news this morning.
-[Leclerc] Good.
[Hoffer] Good to have you around.
We have done a post for you, saying…
[Vettel] Yeah, I saw, thank you.
Yeah. Thank you, Silvia.
[Hoffer] No, not "Thank you, Silvia,"
it's all of us.
Now, uh, in terms of the, um, timing
of the announcement, Sebastian.
We had quite a lot of people say,
"Sebastian, you know,
announced this on this day,"
and everything.
Of course, we believe it was triggered
by last night's announcement from Perez,
which came out so late.
It was obviously a last-minute thing,
so this is our position when we get asked.
-[Vettel] Yeah. It's the truth as well.
-[Hoffer] Okay.
The timing probably tells you everything.
He probably couldn't have picked
a more inappropriate time…
[chuckles] …for the team,
but I guess he was pissed off.
[PR official] So, on my side,
I have, uh, um, some Information
about Saturday evening,
the event that we will have in Firenze.
It's mandatory, guys, to be sharp
because we will have a lot
of important Ferrari family guests there,
so we cannot really be late.
[Buxton] It kind of takes the shine
off Ferrari's big celebration,
but it puts the focus back on Sebastian.
[dramatic music playing]
-[shutters clicking]
-[crowd cheering, whistling]
[Gow] I think Sebastian Vettel feels
that with Racing Point,
which will become Aston Martin next year,
he can build this team up
to be incredible.
[Vettel] The future now is very exciting.
My number one ambition is
to be at the front of the grid,
fight for something worth fighting for
and have fun and enjoy.
[Binotto] I think
Ferrari has always proved
to be capable
of reacting to the difficulties.
Uh, we know that we need
to turn that into determination.
We are still investing in the future,
committed to creating solid foundations.
[Leclerc] My job is to help the team.
Miracles don't happen in Formula 1,
so we need to stay focused on what we do.
I believe that if we continue to work
step by step in the right direction,
we'll manage to be
in a much better position for next year.
[crowd cheering, whistling]
[Binotto] Ferrari is a legendary brand.
Ferrari have always been part
of motor racing.
Ferrari is somehow unique,
and Ferrari is a family.
And being a family,
somehow, it's a passion.
We are a great team
and we will develop the right car.
That's what makes me confident
that we can certainly do better
in the future.
{\an8}[commentator] <i>The big news of the week is</i>
<i>that Ricciardo is on his way to McLaren.</i>
-Is Cyril talking to you yet?
-[laughs]
[Cyril] With the breakup, I am emotional.
It's like being dumped by a girlfriend,
but she hasn't moved out the house yet.
{\an8}Pierre's confidence
has completely transformed.
[Gasly] I wanted to prove myself
as a driver.
I deserve to go back to Red Bull.
Fuck yes!
[commentator] <i>Haas's problems continue.</i>
In a season like this,
small mistakes have big consequences.
If you're not good enough,
you will be spat out.
-[tires squealing]
-[crashing]
[tense music playing]Pure focus on this season's performance.
[commentator 1] <i>Oh, what's happened</i>
<i>to the Renault here of Daniel Ricciardo?</i>
<i>Is he stuck in third gear?</i>
[Cyril] What a mess.
[commentator 1]
<i>Daniel Ricciardo, out of the race.</i>
[Cyril] Shit.
We need to be in a position to fight
for podiums and then fight for wins
and then fight for championships.
[chuckles]
But Daniel has put a stop to all of that.
[commentator 2] <i>The big news of the week</i>
<i>is that Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>is on his way to McLaren.</i>
<i>What do you make of that?</i>
I've done my best in not being hurt,
in not making it personal,
Daniel leaving me.
-[Daniel] Hey, dude.
-[Cyril] Hey.
[commentator 1]
<i>Ricciardo's on a monster salary, </i>
<i>so from Renault's point of view,</i>
<i>they're sort of thinking,</i>
<i>"Come on, we've given you</i>
<i>everything you've asked for and more,</i>
<i>and you've not actually given us a chance</i>
<i>to prove we're on a better trajectory</i>
<i>than McLaren."</i>
[Cyril] What's been,
I guess, hurting the most,
is the fact
that it's not the long-term project
that I thought we had signed up for.
[producer] Why McLaren, do you think?
Ask him. [chuckles]
Ask him. Ask him.
[engine revving]
[machinery whirring]
[engine revving]
-[Daniel] All right, let's go.
-[Italiano] Let's do it.
-Are we taking the buggy?
-[Daniel] Yeah.
[Italiano] Oh, happy days.
This is a setup, by the way.
-Yeah.
-[Italiano] This is rad.
-Yeah.
-[R&B music playing]
[engine starts]
[Daniel] We can just train here.
This is a good little deck.
[Italiano] I'll get you to do a bit
of original Bagger boxing warm-up, mate.
Why does your hair always look so good?
{\an8}-Do you dye it?
-Just don't wash it.
{\an8}It looks darker. [giggles]
No shit, actually.
I'm not just saying that.
You look good when you do it too.
-Yeah?
-Mm.
[Daniel] All right, let's do it.
Three, two, one, go.
[Daniel] Obviously, yeah,
it was my decision to leave Renault.
But, uh,
yeah,
{\an8}there was a few sleepless nights, I think,
trying to figure out what was best.
I feel you can be honest with yourself
when you're on your own.
I'll get a chance to,
like, reflect on last year.
The goals when I joined Renault was,
by year two,
the podium was really
what we believed we could be at.
But…
[engine revving]
…it can't get worse than last year.
[commentator 1] <i>Here comes</i>
<i>Daniel Ricciardo in the Renault!</i>
Okay, let's give a big round of applause
to Daniel, please. Thank you.
[whistling, applause]
[commentator 3] <i>Ricciardo was promised</i>
<i>a team that could</i>
<i>take the fight to the big teams,</i>
<i>and when he joined it, it was actually</i>
<i>a team that went backwards.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>Oh, a big plume of smoke</i>
<i>from Daniel Ricciardo!</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Oh dear!</i>
[Daniel] Even from that point,
I was asking questions, like,
"Can I win with all cars finishing?"
Uh…
It still hurts to say this.
Like, the reality is no.
Everything just cut out.
[commentator 1]
<i>That looks like a massive engine problem.</i>
[Daniel] Deep down,
I knew that I had to go.
So I chose to leave.
[commentator 3]
<i>Daniel Ricciardo leaves Renault.</i>
<i>They've lost</i>
<i>their star driver effectively.</i>
[Daniel] Last year, there was always
conversations going on with McLaren.
I think they made the biggest step
out of any team in 2019.
[commentator 4]
<i>Lando Norris, round the outside!</i>
[commentator 5] <i>The Renault looks slower</i>
<i>than a slow thing down the straights. </i>
[Daniel] And I did
take my age into account. I'm 31.
So I can't afford
to chance any more seasons.
-How are you, dude?
-All good.
And I just felt McLaren was in
a better place than... than Renault was,
and that was really what...
what drove me to that decision.
[upbeat electronic music playing]
[airplanes whirring]
Hello.
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome along</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen to round two.</i>
Hello.
[commentator 1] <i>We're still in Austria,</i>
<i>still at the Red Bull Ring,</i>
<i>but this is the first ever</i>
<i>Styrian Grand Prix.</i>
[woman] Okay, you've got five minutes
until the next thing.
-Okay.
-Which will be in your driver room.
[Daniel] Hello.
Oh. Can I come here or not?
[Horner] Of course.
-Hey. How are ya?
-[Daniel] Hello.
Or whatever it is. We could do that.
-You're okay? All good?
-[Daniel] Good, mate. Yeah.
-Feels good to be back into it.
-[Horner] Yeah.
It doesn't feel
like it's been that long actually.
[Horner] No. It's amazing
how quickly it all comes back, huh?
So tell me, is, uh,
is Cyril talking to you yet?
Yeah. Yeah. [chuckles]
[all chuckle]
[man] That'd be about right.
Oh well.
{\an8}It's probably
a bit like being dumped by a girlfriend,
{\an8}but she hasn't moved out of the house yet.
-All right. I'll go see my guys. [laughs]
-[Horner] All right.
All right, boys. Have fun!
[Horner] It must be
an odd dynamic for Cyril.
[Daniel] Hello.
[Horner] Knowing
for the entirety of the season
that he's going
to their biggest competitor.
{\an8}[Daniel] I'll give you some knuckles.
{\an8}-[indistinct chatter]
-Can you go away?
{\an8}-[Daniel chuckles]
-[Seidl] Without the microphone.
[Horner] It is tough.
You naturally shut down
to that individual, because,
you know, they've... they've left you.
Cyril, no doubt,
took that very personally.
[upbeat electronic music playing]
[Cyril] With the breakup,
uh, there was a period of time
where we've not spoken.
[in French] Don't forget your mask.
{\an8}[in English] I am emotional. I am Latin.
I am a bit Mediterranean and French.
{\an8}So I am emotional.
I'm not going to change what I am.
Frankly, I think he's making a mistake.
[Daniel] Oh, actually, I'll take a water.
[Cyril] The drivers
with the biggest results, biggest success
have also been the ones
that have been able to take their time
and to bring stability in their own life,
in their own career.
But right now I have to accept
that our priority
is to believe in the dynamic with Daniel.
We need to focus on the season
that we need to do together.
[sighs heavily]
[Cyril] Hey.
[Daniel] All right.
Oh well.
[Daniel sighs]
Itchy.
[commentator 1] <i>Five days since we last</i>
<i>put the cars on this circuit, we go again.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>Here comes Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
With Daniel leaving,
deciding to do something different,
it's a very difficult situation.
But on the top of that,
there is one more layer of complexity
to deal with right now.
[commentator 1] <i>There goes Lance Stroll</i>
<i>in the Racing Point</i>
<i>with an awful lot of pace.</i>
{\an8}It's only the second race of the season,
but we've got our first controversy,
{\an8}and it's one that's been brewing
ever since Racing Point unveiled a car
that the paddock quickly nicknamed
the "Pink Mercedes,"
because the other teams
think it's so similar-looking
to last year's
all-conquering Mercedes Formula 1 car.
Racing Point insist
they've done absolutely nothing wrong,
the car is completely legal
and within the regulations.
But this sleeping giant, which now has
big funding from Lawrence Stroll,
I think has got a lot of teams scared.
[commentator 2] <i>Here goes Sergio Perez.</i>
<i>He's absolutely flying.</i>
{\an8}You love racing, it obviously
doesn't get any better than Formula 1.
This year, we're already witnessing
the team, with the right resources,
getting an opportunity
to show what they can do.
[commentator 2]
<i>Watch out for Perez and Stroll.</i>
<i>Racing Point certainly have pace.</i>
[Lawrence] We have bigger aspirations
than that.
And that's winning.
[Otmar] He's going well.
This season,
it seems like we've got a good chance
of being better than McLaren,
than Renault.
We'll have a very good chance
{\an8}at, uh, finishing either at the top
of the midfield or a little bit higher.
[Cyril] Racing Point,
I want to understand,
um,
what happened there, frankly.
We have a car that is very much
uh, like the Mercedes car of last year,
painted in pink, obviously.
That's hurting,
because I don't understand.
[Lance] We've made such big steps
from where we were last year.
It's hard to believe.
{\an8}And I have, uh,
you know, a great car under me.
{\an8}So I'm really just riding a good wave.
And, uh, there will always be
controversy in this sport.
There's no peace in Formula 1.
No team should enhance
the competitiveness of another team,
other than as per the regulation.
[Zak] We'll talk after the race.
-[Cyril] Yes.
-[Zak] Good.
[Cyril] A number of teams want to
understand exactly what's behind the car.
I think it's the tip of the iceberg,
that, uh, it needs to be looked at
much more closely.
[Claire] It can give you
a good leapfrog up the order,
{\an8}and that situation can't occur.
{\an8}[Zak] Obviously,
we've been quite vocal this year
{\an8}that, um, you know,
{\an8}we don't think what they've done
with their race car this year,
uh, is right.
[Otmar] Yeah, I heard what Zak said.
Quite frankly, I don't think
he's ever engineered a car in his life.
I don't think he's ever drawn a part
in his life.
So for him to say that,
that doesn't hold any water with me.
[commentator 1] <i>It's approaching 2 p.m.</i>
<i>About 15 minutes to go till lights out.</i>
<i>The cars are leaving the garage.</i>
<i>You can hear the rev...</i>
[dance music playing]
[machinery whirring]
[Daniel] Here today, for sure,
there's probably people,
you know, in Renault
who maybe think where you're at,
and kind of where your head is
and where your commitment is,
but my hunger for beating every driver
on the grid is still the same.
Five zero.
[Italiano] Ooh!
[Daniel barks]
[Italiano] The man is light.
[Daniel] I'm not just driving
for a paycheck, put it that way.
100% athlete.
From my side, I...
I 100% want to try and…
get it through to Cyril
that, you know, look, um,
"McLaren is 2021."
"I'm not thinking about that now."
"I still really, really, really want to do
what I can with you guys."
[Cyril] It's immensely difficult,
but it's really important
to leave the emotion on one side.
With Daniel and myself,
I don't want
to build bridges artificially.
Right now, our focus, our single focus,
needs to be on beating Racing Point.
-[machinery whirring]

[commentator 1]

<i>having a go at Ricciardo before too long.</i>
{\an8}[Loos] <i>Stroll, 0.6 behind.</i>
[Daniel] Okay. Understood.
[Loos] <i>Stroll, 0.4 behind you.</i>
[thrilling music playing]
[Loos] <i>Stroll, 0.3 behind.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Final lap. Lance Stroll</i>
<i>goes down the inside of Daniel Ricciardo!</i>
<i>Ooh! He barges his way through!</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>That was a clumsy move there.</i>
{\an8}[Lance] Let's go! Big points in the bag.
-Nice one, guys.
-[cheering]
{\an8}[Daniel] I saw him
at the apex at the last moment.
If I turned in, we'd crash.
Pretty shit day.
[Cyril in French] Shit. Shit!
I hate those fucking pink cars.
[Buxton in English] We'll talk
about how Renault got on today.
We're gonna talk first about Racing Point.
Lance, talk us through your race.
[Lance] Yeah, some,
uh, great points for the team.
Um, there was a lot...
[Daniel] All I thought about
after the race was the battle with Stroll.
A bit of a controversial one.
[commentator 4] <i>Stroll went off the track</i>
<i>and Daniel had to take avoiding action,</i>
<i>if Daniel hadn't got out,</i>
<i>he would've been pushed off</i>
<i>and contact would have been made.</i>
[Daniel] I was obviously upset with him.
But I also felt like
the Racing Point is so fast
they're gonna be a threat,
I think, at every circuit we go to.
Oh, fucking hell.
I was, I dunno, four tenths up
when I came into the pits or something.
-[Marcin] Yeah.
-[Daniel] But, still, the pace. I was…
struggling to hold on
to the Racing Points.
-Which is what we discussed this morning.
-[Daniel] Yeah. Yeah.
-[Cyril] Well…
-[Daniel in French] Fuck!
[Buxton in English] A number of teams
in the paddock
have got an issue
with that Racing Point car.
But all it takes is one team to protest,
and the first one that did
was Cyril and Renault.
[indistinct chatter]
[Cyril] We have decided to protest
against Racing Point.
We believe that this car is not legal,
doesn't comply with the regulations,
and, as such, should be sanctioned.
[Buxton] Renault have gone after
a part of the car
that you cannot see with the naked eye.
They're focused
on Racing Point's brake ducts.
[Otmar] Last year,
to help us with brake duct design,
we purchased some information
from Mercedes.
Information on listed parts is not allowed
to be passed from team to team,
which means you have to design
and develop 'em yourself.
The brake ducts were
a non-listed part last year
and are a listed part this year.
I don't think the FIA can point to a rule
that we contravened.
Everything we did was legal,
and for anybody to suggest otherwise,
um,
is incorrect.
{\an8}[Cyril] Today,
I have the hearing for Racing Point,
set up by the FIA with the stewards
that will be judging the case.
My responsibility is to...
to make sure that I look after Renault.
We are not fighting
on a level playing field.
Marilyn, how are you?
[Marilyn] I'm very well, thank you.
[Cyril] I want to understand
what Formula 1 stands for today,
and what will it stand for tomorrow?
That's what's at stake.
Not started yet. No.
It's very much the governing bodies
that are leading the show.
The FIA needs to set the tone
of what we will be up and doing.
"Please wait.
The meeting host will let you in soon."
It's not like the race start.
It doesn't start on time.
[chuckles]
[electronic music playing]
[indistinct chattering]
[Cyril in French] So, Racing Point.
[man] Racing Point's arguments
are bullshit.
Those parts are what make
the difference in performance.
It's the parts
that increase the performance
and everyone looks after themselves.
That's fundamentally what makes Formula 1.
{\an8}It's not very cool, all this.
{\an8}[Cyril] Mm.
{\an8}It's not the essence of F1. It's not.
-[Cyril] Yeah.
-[Alain] Yeah, for sure.
[Otmar in English] Today, we've gotta deal
with the Renault protest, the verdict.
However, we're good at overcoming
those types of regulations
and extracting the most performance
out of a car.
-I'm gonna go call Lawrence.
-[Green] Yeah, okay.
-[Toto] Good morning.
-[cameraman] Morning.
[Toto] Lawrence Stroll is someone
who doesn't do things half-heartedly.
And he provided the very good people
at Racing Point with more resource.
{\an8}I mean, the whole Racing Point saga,
{\an8}it's just a little bit of, uh, comedy.
[pop music playing]
[Cyril] We have the hearing
for the protest.
[Ocon] What if it's illegal?
Then what's the next step?
[Cyril] I guess, if it's illegal,
it should be, uh, disqualified from all
the races that we've protested so far.
[Ocon] Yeah, that's good.
For me, it's very difficult,
{\an8}'cause, you know,
it's all about the politics outside
{\an8}and the talks and who decides what,
{\an8}and, you know, it goes out of your control
and that's as simple as that.
-[Ocon] Will they have to change the part?
-[Cyril] They would have to.
-Go. I'll see you guys later.
-[Daniel] Strategy meeting.
-[Cyril] Is it now?
-[Daniel] Uh…
[Buxton] There's always two sides
to a protest in Formula 1.
But Renault feel that what Racing Point
have done this year crosses the line.
So today's judgment,
today's ruling from the FIA,
has massive ramifications
for the future of the sport.
[cameras clicking]
[Buxton] It's been a long time coming,
but we're expecting the results
of the FIA protest any minute now.
As we know, Renault are...
[man] Okay, we win, but not completely.
-[Cyril] Oh.
-[man] Protest is upheld.
A 200,000 euro fine for each car
and a 7.5 points deduction for each car.
-[Marcin] 7.5 points. From what?
-[Cyril] 7.5 points?
[man] Yeah.
15 points for the constructors.
[Marcin] Out of how many scored?
-[chuckling]
-[man] Forty-two.
And do they make tea all weekend
for all the teams
or is there any kind of forced labor?
[Cyril] Can I drive Otmar's car?
I think he's got a fantastic collection.
If I can drive his collection of cars,
I'm fine.
[man] No, that's… that's a fucking…
that's fucking bullshit.
[Cyril] Let's be factual.
This decision, frankly, it's unfair.
[Otmar] What we've done
is completely legal,
and our competitors are kicking themselves
for not having thought of doing the same.
[Buxton] Racing Point have been fined
for their use of these brake ducts,
but they're allowed to keep using them.
Renault are not happy,
and they're not the only ones.
McLaren and Williams have joined
the appeal, and, crucially, Ferrari.
{\an8}[Mattia] Is the penalty the right one?
Just a starting point.
{\an8}[Zak] I think, you know,
everyone's got to kind of work together
when we see something in the sport
that we think is outside the rules.
I think this is the, uh, start
of this situation, not the end.
Right.
[indistinct chattering]
[Toto] I know that Racing Point
didn't do anything wrong.
Some people felt under pressure
with their performances
and started on that mission,
trying to find reasons
why their performances were not
at the level they should have been.
We just acknowledged that
they did a good job, and others didn't.
[indistinct chattering]
Racing Point. Well, Otmar, fined,
points deducted, 400,000 euros.
Does it feel
like a real knockdown right now for you?
[Otmar] Well, it's not ideal.
It's a shame that the protest was upheld,
but we did absolutely nothing wrong.
Otmar, 24 hours to appeal. Will you do it?
We read the sporting regulations.
There is nothing specific in there
that says we couldn't do what we did.
But the car is legal.
The brake ducts
are compliant with the regulations
and we can continue to run 'em
for the rest of the year.
Um, so are you gonna appeal?
You have 24 hours.
[Otmar] 24 hours.
They're saying that you've got
no intentional wrongdoing, is the gist?
[Otmar] Yeah, I think
there's no wrongdoing whatsoever.
It's just the rules were ambiguous,
and still are today.
[electronic music playing]
The verdict itself is flawed.
We invited the FIA into the factory.
We showed 'em all of our designs,
and they were completely fine with that.
So the verdict today was, um…
uh, illogical to me.
We didn't… We didn't contravene one rule.
[Fry] That's ridiculous.
[man] Yeah, the fine's a joke, isn't it,
to someone like their team owner.
[Marcin] There he is.
♪ <i>Down at the bottom of the ocean ♪</i>
<i>♪ Down at the bottom of the sea ♪</i>
<i>♪ I will stay down, down ♪</i>
<i>♪ Gone, long gone ♪</i>
[Lawrence] Okay,
whenever you're ready to roll.
-[producer] In your own time
-Baby, go.
[dramatic music playing]
Good morning.
I do not often speak publicly.
However, I'm extremely angry
at any suggestion that we have cheated.
This team, under various names, has
competed in Formula 1 for over 30 years.
Between 2016 and '18,
this was the fourth-best team on the grid.
We've always been a constructor,
and will continue to be so in the future.
Beyond the clear fact that Racing Point
complied with the technical regulations,
I am appalled by the way
Renault, McLaren, Ferrari and Williams
have taken this opportunity to appeal,
and, in doing so, attempted
to distract from our performances.
These accusations
are completely unacceptable and not true.
They are dragging our name
through the mud,
and I will not stand by, nor accept this.
In closing,
we did absolutely nothing wrong.
We stayed within the rules.
And we will demonstrate and prove that
through the appeal process.
Thank you for your time.
[electronic music playing]
-Good?
-[Otmar] Good.
-Very good.
-[Lawrence] Nailed it?
[Otmar] Nailed it. Well done.
[Lawrence] This whole
"Pink Mercedes" thing is nonsense.
Our competitors, I think
they have to look at their own competence.
They have their own factories.
They have their own guys.
They simply didn't do a good enough job.
Okay, now let's race
and let's fix this problem.
[Daniel] Uh, mate,
he wants us to be ready.
-[Italiano] Yeah?
-[Daniel] Yeah.
[Daniel] The Racing Point protest,
at the end of the day,
I see them as a competitor right now,
and if they're faster,
we've gotta find a way to do better.
[helicopter blades whirring]
[commentator] <i>We're 40 minutes away</i>
<i>from the start of the British Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Glorious sounds</i>
<i>of engines beginning to rev.</i>..
[Cyril] It's up to us now to demonstrate
what we have to achieve as a team.
And what you want is to win.
And we want to beat them.
-That front wing looks like ours, Cyril.
-Yeah.
We took some pictures.
[Otmar chuckles]
[Cyril] Fuck!
[engineer] <i>One minute.</i>
<i>Engines start, and drop the car down.</i>
[Daniel] As of today,
a very basic goal I have for myself
is to leave this track with no regrets.
No hesitations. Just conviction.
Decisiveness.
I want to beat that team.
You have to do it. It's just…
You have to do it.
[suspenseful music playing]
[engines revving]
[commentator 1]
<i>Great start for Daniel Ricciardo!</i>
{\an8}[Joyce] Okay, Lance,
Ricciardo close behind.
{\an8}[Lance] Okay. Copy.
[Loos] Okay, Daniel, just keep pushing.
{\an8}[Daniel] Yep. Understood.
[commentator 2]
<i>Here comes Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>round the outside of Lance Stroll.</i>
[Italiano] Come on, DR!
{\an8}[commentator 1]
<i>He's done it. Gets the move done.</i>
[Lance] Frickin'!
He's pulling away from me..
-[Cyril] <i>Allez!</i>
-[team member] Yeah! [applause]
[Otmar] Shit. What happened?
[Mark] Okay, Esteban.
It's Stroll in front of you.
Vettel behind you.
{\an8}[Ocon] Copy, yeah.
[commentator 1]
<i>Here comes Sebastian Vettel!</i>
<i>Locks up, can't get past Ocon.</i>
All of us at Renault, we have a vision
for where we want to take the team.
With Daniel leaving,
Esteban is absolutely crucial.
[commentator 1] <i>Ocon to the inside</i>
<i>of Lance Stroll into the left-hander.</i>
<i>Wheel to wheel,</i>
<i>Stroll's trying to hang on,</i>
<i>and he manages it.</i>
Ah, c'mon!
[commentator 1] <i>Here comes Ocon again!</i>
<i>This time, to the outside.</i>
<i>Stroll squeezes him.</i>
<i>And he still keeps hold of ninth place.</i>
[Joyce] Push all you've got.
Push all you've got.
[Lance] <i>I am pushing.</i>
[Otmar] This is gonna be tough.
[commentator 1]
<i>Ooh, there's a lock-up as well.</i>
<i>So is the pressure intensifying, I wonder,</i>
<i>as Esteban Ocon is now</i>
<i>only half a second behind Lance Stroll?</i>
C'mon!
[commentator 2]
<i>Two drivers, really going for it.</i>
<i>And Esteban Ocon is past the Racing Point!</i>
C'mon!
[whoops] Yes!
[commentator 2] <i>Having stared at the back</i>
<i>of that Racing Point all race long,</i>
<i>Esteban's got past</i>
<i>and up into eighth place.</i>
[Cyril] Now we've got a race.
[commentator 1]
<i>So Hamilton leads from Valtteri Bottas.</i>
<i>Then, in third, comes Max Verstappen.</i>
<i>Behind them though, they're still</i>
<i>squabbling away for position.</i>
[Loos] Okay, Daniel,
so currently, you're P7.
Same pace as Norris and Sainz ahead.
[Daniel] Understood.
[commentator 1] <i>Ricciardo is putting</i>
<i>Lando Norris under pressure.</i>
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>Ah, brilliant stuff there.</i>
<i>He moves up into sixth place.</i>
[crew member] Go on!
[Italiano] Come on, DR! Boom!
[commentator 2]
<i>It's game on now, isn't it?</i>
[Loos] <i>Okay, nice job.</i>
<i>Sainz in front of you, next one.</i>
[Daniel] Okay.
[Cyril] One thing I must say is that,
watching Daniel,
right now, it's something that's making me
feel the frustration and disappointment.
Not just for what we have achieved
so far together,
but also for what he would achieve
after... after that.
But he decided to make the decision
when he decided to make it,
with just one year together,
in such a short region of time.
[Loos] <i>You're doing a good job.</i>
<i>Two tenths quicker than Sainz ahead.</i>
[Daniel] Okay, yep. Understood.
[commentator 1] <i>Here come the Mercedes,</i>
<i>stretching their advantage out front.</i>
<i>Oh, and what's happened? Bottas.</i>
<i>There's a puff of smoke there.</i>
<i>We'll try and figure out what's happened.</i>
[Loos] So Bottas has
a front-left puncture.
[Daniel] Understood.
[commentator 2] <i>Now, Bottas pits.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Sainz and Ricciardo</i>
<i>go through ahead of Bottas</i>
[Loos] Okay. Currently, you're P5.
Seeing a few punctures.
<i>How are the tires?</i>
[Daniel] They're okay.
I can hold this for now.
[Loos] Carlos is struggling
with vibration,
so let's keep the pressure up on him.
[Daniel] Let's go.
[commentator 1]
<i>Ooh, Sainz has gone wide.</i>
<i>The same thing's happened to the McLaren.</i>
<i>The tires are failing at Silverstone.</i>
[Italiano] Come on, Daniel!
[commentator 1] <i>And Ricciardo's</i>
<i>got through, up to fourth position.</i>
[Italiano] Yeah! Go on!
[Loos] Nice job, mate.
Let's bring it home now.
[commentator 2] <i>Daniel Ricciardo is</i>
<i>on his way </i>
<i>to take fourth position in this race.</i>
<i>What a performance that is.</i>
[cars zooming]
Woo-hoo!
[Daniel] Fuck.
Nice. Nice. Nice.
[Cyril] He gave everything.
<i>Great race, Daniel.</i>
[Daniel chuckles]
Got a bit exciting at the end.
[Cyril] Super race. Thanks a lot.
[commentator 2] <i>And Esteban Ocon crosses</i>
<i>the line to finish sixth.</i>
[cheering]
[Cyril] Great drive, Esteban.
[Ocon] Awesome. Good points.
[Cyril] <i>Super team result. Super.</i>
[Italiano] The last three laps,
just mayhem, mate.
Mate, good race. P4, boy.
-Yeah.
-You and Esteban were doing well.
[reporter] You have the perfect lineup
to be ready
for that kind of opportunity, right?
[Cyril] Exactly.
I mean, when the car is reliable…
I have to admit that,
with Daniel, I want to move on,
so that we are extremely focused,
150% focused,
on what's going to be
a super-intense season together.
[woman] Everyone wants
to talk to you. Everyone.
[Daniel] Maybe another lap or two,
we could be on the podium,
but, uh, we have next week,
another chance.
[Cyril] We all want
to see Daniel on the podium with Renault
as quickly as possible.
Right now, we have a job to do together.
[Daniel] To finish fourth,
it's really cool, so very happy.
Um, yeah,
just feels quite rewarding, this one.
-[Daniel] So close!
-[Cyril] So close!
-[Daniel] So close.
-That's good.
-Thank you for that. Thank you.
-No worries.
And thank you
for a couple of very nice maneuvers.
It was nice.
It was fun, huh? It was a fun race.
-[Daniel] Crazy.
-[Cyril] Thanks for that. Cheers.
[Cyril] Here, today,
after what we have achieved together,
maybe all of us are a bit closer.
I am in the process
of rebuilding my relationship with him.
Even though I have...
I have full confidence
that he will regret his decision.
Sitting here today, I don't know if
it's the best call I've ever made or not.
I've obviously, in a way,
taken a bit of a punt.
It could swing either way.
I'll need a whiskey.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Pierre Gasly,</i>
<i>what an incredible run of form.</i>
Now we're gonna score some fucking points.
[Horner] Alex has to prove
he's worthy of that seat.
[commentator 2]
<i>Albon and Gasly, wheel to wheel.</i>
The fight is on.
{\an8}[Buxton] Last year, Carlos and Lando
had a great relationship.
This year, is very different.
[Sainz] Carlos, one. Lando, zero.
[producer] How do you sum up
our season this year?
[Steiner] It's one short word.
Shit. [giggles]
[dramatic music playing]Fucking hell! No!
[tense music playing]
Last year was probably
the hardest moment of my life.
I had the Red Bull demotion.
I got moved from Red Bull to Toro Rosso.
[commentator 1] <i>Alex Albon,</i>
<i>after just 12 races in Formula 1,</i>
<i>has now replaced Pierre Gasly at Red Bull.</i>
It was a really horrible and…
and difficult time for me to go through.
Yeah, of course, I got a lot of shit.
Did you get any advance warning?
Well…
[Buxton] Pierre was demoted
in a very public fashion.
[reporter] You're surprised by
the decision. Do you believe it was fair?
[suspenseful music playing]
[Gasly] In 2020,
I feel I'm a more complete driver
and probably performing
at my best level at the moment.
[Buxton] Alongside Lewis Hamilton
and Max Verstappen,
Pierre Gasly is…
[chuckling] …undoubtedly
the driver of 2020 so far.
[knuckles cracking]
[Gasly] I deserve to go back to Red Bull.
[engine rumbling]
And that's the target, yeah, that's clear.
-[machinery whirring]
-[engine revving]
[relaxing R&B music playing]
Is it the jacket with the trousers
or the jacket with jeans?
-[woman] Whatever.
-My jeans are good. Don't touch my jeans.
{\an8}Okay, that's nice.
{\an8}I think this is gonna go great. Look.
[camera clicking]
Get this.
-[man 1] Yeah, that's right.
-[camera clicking]
[chuckling]
-[Gasly] Oh my God!
-Here he is.
[Gasly] Who is this wild animal?
[Kvyat chuckles]
It's actually good, the weather now.
Yeah, when the sun's out,
it's getting much hotter.
Yeah, but you're hot all the time, right?
-No.
-When I get close to you, you get hot.
No, not really. Somehow… somehow not.
Not anymore.
"Not anymore"
means at some point, it worked!
Of course, yeah.
[Buxton] AlphaTauri is the new name
for Toro Rosso.
{\an8}It is a solid midfield team.
{\an8}Its only reason for existing
over the past decade
{\an8}was as a Formula 1 school
for Red Bull's young drivers.
[indistinct chattering]
[Buxton] Pierre's confidence
since going back to AlphaTauri
has completely transformed.
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>Pierre Gasly closing in.</i>
<i>They go side by side.</i>
[Gasly] Fuck yes!
[commentator 2]
<i>Sensational for AlphaTauri.</i>
<i>Now, can Gasly keep his foot in?</i>
<i>He can, to get past the Ferrari driver.</i>
[Gasly] Yes!
Ah, yes! [chuckles]
[Hamelin] <i>That feels nice.</i>
<i>Good job, Pierre. Amazing race.</i>
But every driver that races at AlphaTauri
doesn't see their future at AlphaTauri.
[camera clicking]
It's a team where you prove your worth
to Red Bull Racing.
[camera clicking]
[Gasly] For me, it was good to be back.
Suddenly, I understood how to drive again.
This is a bit small, no?
Of course, the car is not as competitive
and, as a competitive guy,
you always wanna be in the fastest car.
My goal will always be to be
in that Red Bull car in the top team.
{\an8}As long as I'm competitive,
as long as I'm pushing,
opportunities will come
and… and that's just my… my spirit
and mentality at the moment.
[suspenseful music playing]
[commentator 1]
<i>Welcome to Spa-Francorchamps,</i>
<i>located deep in Belgium's Ardennes Forest,</i>
<i>one of the oldest Grand Prix circuits</i>
<i>in the world.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>On this Friday morning,</i>
<i>it's Free Practice one.</i>
[Daniel] Hello, Netflix.
I'm totally not smiling right now.
[commentator 1]
<i>The scene of controversy a year ago</i>
<i>when the Red Bull team</i>
<i>dropped Pierre Gasly</i>
<i>from their second seat.</i>
[Horner] Yeah, exactly.
-Here he is.
-Morning.
-Morning.
-Morning.
[Gasly] It's very tough going back to Spa.
All these memories come back.
But I'm not someone gives up.
What's the plan?
[woman] To do the interviews
and the first one is Jennie Gow from BBC.
-[Gasly] Yeah.
-[woman] We'll do it by phone.
[Gow] <i>Now, Pierre,</i>
<i>we all remember the events</i>
<i>of Spa last year.</i>
<i>Obviously, getting demoted from Red Bull.</i>
<i>Why is it that you are</i>
<i>so much more comfortable</i>
<i>in the AlphaTauri team?</i>
<i>You seem happy,</i>
<i>your results speak for themselves,</i>
<i>versus that Red Bull second seat,</i>
<i>which is always one that's uncomfortable,</i>
<i>I think, for everybody that ever takes it?</i>
I don't want to go
into too much details about that,
but they gave Alex the seat last year
because he had some decent results,
um, and… and hopefully, the…
um, yeah, for the… the coming years,
it's gonna be decided
on the same, uh, on the same criteria.
But at the end of the day,
I'm not the one deciding.
{\an8}I think Formula 1 is highly personal,
highly political,
{\an8}so, when it comes to Pierre,
he has a massive point to prove.
[Horner] Unfortunately, I've just had to
have one of the dogs put down, so…
[Vicky] Oh no!
[Horner] It's horrible because
they become such a part of the family.
The mood I'm in, I tell you,
ask me about Pierre.
[reporter 1] It's exactly one year ago
when Red Bull swapped the seats
between, uh, Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon.
[reporter 2] Would you say it's impossible
to have, one day,
Pierre Gasly back at Red Bull?
{\an8}[Horner] He's obviously, uh, back in
and doing a good job in the AlphaTauri
and of course, we monitor his progress.
To drive for Red Bull,
this team is all about delivering.
Obviously, we have a lot of information
on how he's performing and developing.
Pierre's driven some good races this year,
but he's also shown dips as well.
[Gasly] <i>Ça va?</i>
[Horner] Pierre wouldn't have had
the chance to be in Formula 1
without Red Bull.
And the reality is, when you get there,
if you can't cope
with the pressure and scrutiny,
you're never gonna make it
at the highest level in… in Formula 1.
{\an8}I feel people
are gonna critique my shaving.
{\an8}You know, I've got
that kind of like puberty fluffy beard.
-[Harding] You're an aggressive shaver.
-[Albon] I'm an aggressive shaver.
I've never been taught how to shave,
so, um, if anyone wants to sponsor me,
Gillette…?
{\an8}Gillette or Nivea.
{\an8}Nivea aftershave.
I would say, based on your ability
to grow a beard,
aim for the aftershave products
as opposed to the actual shaving products.
[Albon chuckles]
[laughing]
[tense music playing]
[Albon] Last year, I was very much
a schoolkid on my first day of school.
[Albon grunts]
How do you get in this place?
We're not even halfway
through the season yet,
and I still feel very…
very new to the sport.
[Buxton] Alex's performances
so far in 2020 have been good…
[machinery whirring]
…but not great.
Everyone at Red Bull would have expected
at least a podium by now.
[Horner] Right. Let's see what we've got.
[machinery whirring]
[Horner] We're working very hard
with Alex at the moment
to try and find
the confidence in this car that Max has.
The car hasn't been easy this year.
Arguably,
it's been a harder car than last year.
And he's up against Verstappen
who is just in unbelievable form.
[engine rumbling]
{\an8}[Rennie] <i>How's the balance, Alex?</i>
[Albon] This car feels very nervous
into turn one.
It just feels like I'm sliding
from entry to exit.
-Like the tires are gone.
-[Rennie] Okay.
[machinery whirring]
[Horner] You all right?
Does the car seem a bit more settled?
[Albon] It's still nervous,
but at least it's predictable.
[Horner] Yeah.
[Jacques] He doesn't sound
very happy at all, so…
[tense music playing]
[Albon] A year ago,
I was fast-tracked into a big team,
but it doesn't mean that I'm here to stay.
You know, as a Red Bull driver,
you're expected to be
getting podiums, getting wins.
It doesn't feel
like he's enjoying driving the car,
the balance that he's got.
Based on the car this weekend?
Yeah, he's not been comfy in it. I…
It's starting to be a bit of a pattern of…
We just need him to get the…
to hit the ground running earlier.
[Harding] That's all it is.
And then everything
to just be easier for him.
Anyway…
[Harding] Some of that
will be experience as well.
[Horner] He's not far
off the podium, though.
[suspenseful music playing]
[Pyry] Quiet.
[Gasly] Ah, it is, yeah.
Coming back to Spa reminded me
of all the memories from the year before.
{\an8}[reporter in French]<i>The fatal accident</i>
<i>of Antoine Hubert happened</i>
{\an8}<i>at the famous Eau Rouge corner</i>
<i>just behind us.</i>
{\an8}<i>at the most dangerous event of the season</i>
{\an8}<i>in Formula 1 and Formula 2…</i>
[Gasly in English] Last year, I got moved
from Red Bull to Toro Rosso
and then Anthoine passed away
that same weekend.
It was the hardest moment of my life.
[somber music playing]
He was such a… a close friend.
Since we were little kids.
We had the same life goal.
He wanted as much as… as I wanted
to be in Formula 1.
[Gasly] Fucking crazy, eh?
After I got moved from Red Bull,
Anthoine sent me a message.
"Prove everybody wrong and…
show them your… your skills and talent."
[tense music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>It is round seven</i>
<i>of this Formula 1 season in 2020.</i>
[aircraft whirring]
[Lawrence] Hey. How are you?
[Horner] We nearly got
your fucking number two!
[Toto] You know he's gonna be the one
on the brink to turn five. [chuckles]
[Horner] Exactly.
There's only two teams
in the last ten years
that have won World Championships
and that's Red Bull and Mercedes.
And I genuinely think
that we have an outside chance,
but we need both drivers
to maximize the opportunity from the car.
You all right?
If we could put them under pressure,
they would crack.
Just go aggressive.
The pressure is gonna be on Alex
and the best way he can get around that
is to get his first podium.
[commentator 2] <i>Here's the starting grid.</i>
<i>Hamilton on pole, Bottas, Verstappen,</i>
<i>Daniel Ricciardo is fourth</i>
<i>ahead of Alex Albon in fifth.</i>
<i>Pierre Gasly starts 12th for AlphaTauri.</i>
<i>He'll have his work cut out</i>
<i>to get anything in this race.</i>
-[Gasly] How much more time?
-[Hamelin] Race is two minutes to green.
[engines revving]
[suspenseful music playing]
[starting beeps count down]
[Hamelin] <i>Okay, Pierre,</i>
<i>you know the target.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>And we're racing at Spa.</i>
{\an8}[Gasly] Ah, fuck's sake!
{\an8}Lost the rear a bit.
-[crew member] Come on!
-[Horner] Come on!
[commentator 1] <i>Albon getting squirrelly</i>
<i>coming out of turn one</i>
<i>and that's enabled Ocon</i>
<i>to get ahead of him.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Albon now fighting back</i>
<i>after losing that place at the start.</i>
[Rennie] <i>Let's have another go at him.</i>
<i>Get stuck in.</i>
[Horner] Go on, Alex!
[Albon] We can barely catch them with DRS.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Onboard with Pierre Gasly.</i>
[Hamelin] <i>You know what our race is.</i>
<i>We go all in.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>It's all about maximum attack.</i>
[Gasly] After what happened to Anthoine…
I need to show everybody…
[commentator 2]
<i>Here they come into the hairpin.</i>
…that I'm performing better.
[Hamelin] <i>Be careful there.</i>
<i>You have to be careful.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Pérez is gonna be</i>
<i>under pressure here from Gasly.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>What a move that was!</i>
<i>Side by side through Eau Rouge.</i>
[Gasly] That's how we race!
[Hamelin] <i>What a job. That's P11.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>He's got a great chance.</i>
<i>In fact, he's already passed the Ferrari.</i>
[crew member] Come on, Pierre.
[Hamelin] <i>We are back in business. P10.</i>
[cars zooming]
[commentator 3]
<i>Gasly fancies a go, doesn't he?</i>
[cheering]
[Hamelin]<i> That's, uh, P9.</i>
<i>Okay, head down, Pierre, head down.</i>
<i>Stroll in front.</i>
[Gasly] Come on, let's get him.
[commentator 1]
<i>Gasly's now into eighth place.</i>
[cheering, applause]
[whooping]
[commentator 3] <i>Alex Albon</i>
<i>not really making much of an impression.</i>
{\an8}[Rennie] <i>Alex,</i>
<i>it's the last lap now. Stay strong.</i>
[Albon] Yep, okay.
[Rennie] <i>Uh, gap behind</i>
<i>to Ocon is reducing.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Esteban Ocon,</i>
<i>he's got Alex Albon in his sights.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>He's gonna try the move to the outside</i>
<i>and he gets it done.</i>
[crew member] Oh, for fuck's sake!
[commentator 2]
<i>Lewis Hamilton, another win.</i>
<i>Mercedes one-two.</i>
<i>It's third place for Max Verstappen,</i>
{\an8}<i>and Alex Albon just holds onto sixth,</i>
<i>losing out on yet another podium.</i>
<i>Just couldn't make an impact.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Gasly crosses the line</i>
<i>with a fine performance,</i>
<i>gaining four positions to eighth place</i>
<i>and Driver of the Day as well.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>I mean,</i>
<i>take a bow, Pierre Gasly.</i>
[Hamelin] <i>What a drive, Pierre.</i>
[Gasly] Wow!
[engineer ]Fuck yeah!
{\an8}[Rennie] <i>Okay, Alex,</i>
<i>hard luck there in the end.</i>
{\an8}[Albon] Yep. [scoffs]
[somber music playing]
[Harding groans]
[Vicky] It was unreal.
[Horner] It was a shit race, though.
[Harding] There's not much more
you could've done.
When things don't go well,
I'm my harshest critic.
You can't… You can't hide it.
It's just really tough.
There's no point
feeling sorry for yourself
and that's all there is to it.
Can we do a little foot tap? [chuckling]
[Buxton] Driver of the Day.
Dude, if it wasn't for social distancing,
I'd give you a hug. What an amazing drive.
[crew member]
You mastered six moves in the end.
[Gasly] Oh yeah?
My favorite one was the one on Pérez.
I was like, "If he keeps going,
we're both in the wall,
and I'm just fucking going for it, so…"
It's such a strange place
for Gasly to be in.
[chuckles]
It's just bonkers how well he's done.
He's still got a point to prove
and he still wants that Red Bull seat.
[reporter] Pierre, what you think
this strong form might potentially mean
for your future career,
from you being dropped by Red Bull?
[Gasly] At the end of the day,
it's… it's not my call.
I've always believed
as long as you put strong performances,
sooner or later, opportunities will come.
[cameras clicking]
[Horner] It's great to see
our sister team, AlphaTauri, uh,
doing a fantastic job.
Good for Pierre as well.
Uh, he looks very comfortable
in that environment.
He looks… looks, uh, relaxed
and he's driving at the potential
that we knew he had.
[reporter on computer] <i>Obviously,</i>
<i>Pierre got Driver of the Day today.</i>
<i>Does it put him back in the frame</i>
<i>for a future with Red Bull?</i>
Pierre? Um…
Well, I think he's…
he's, uh, performing well at AlphaTauri,
but I think we're, you know,
we're happy with the way things are.
-Okay.
-[Jacques] Cheers, guys.
See you next week.
Helmut and I looked at,
you know, the information.
{\an8}Our decisions,
they're not just made on emotion.
They're based on facts.
They're based on a huge amount of data,
a huge amount of analysis.
From a team point of view,
there's been
nobody pushing internally to say,
"We've gotta have Pierre back."
[exciting music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome along</i>
<i>on a Friday afternoon</i>
<i>in this glorious part of Italy.</i>
<i>It's round eight</i>
<i>of the Formula 1 World Championship.</i>
<i>Nowhere excites quite like Monza.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>At the Temple of Speed,</i>
<i>a final farewell after 43 years,</i>
<i>it's time to say thank you</i>

[Steiner] I told him, now he has to deal
with you at home every day.
{\an8}[Claire] Thanks!
I'll be asking you for a job.
{\an8}Do you need a PA?
[chuckling]
[Leclerc] Sorry!
[man in Italian] Why is it, as soon
as the cameras are on, you mess up?
[Daniel in English]
I just hope we can overtake this time.
-[Max] I think it's gonna be hard.
-[Daniel] Yeah.
[Ocon] Ready for a good day.
[tense music playing]
[Jacques]
Remember what I was saying earlier,
if they start hammering you,
don't stand for any bollocks.
We're in control.
[reporter 1]
You've had your ups and downs,
but Christian and the whole team,
they've been very supportive of you,
publicly at least.
[reporter 2] Sometimes, in sport,
you get a result that changes everything.
Is maybe that what you need?
You think you can fight
towards the podium?
It could be that Red Bull
genuinely believe that Alex is the one,
that Alex has the potential
that Pierre didn't.
[Horner] I don't… Look, I think
Alex is a great racing driver.
I don't think
we've seen the best of him yet.
Uh, we have no interest in… in having
Pierre back, you know, this season.
On the other hand, it could just be that…
they cannot bring themselves to admit
that they made a mistake.
[Pyry] Rumble time.
Welcome to Gas-man's <i>Carpool Karaoke</i>.
[chuckles]
[Gasly] So, do you want the news?
"No 2020 Red Bull return for Gasly,"
Horner said.
"Alex is only going to get better."
"He's still pretty young and inexperienced
and we are doing all we can
to support and develop him."
But seriously, it's like…
It's a joke.
How they treat this is a joke.
I have my target.
The fight is on.
And now,
we're gonna score some fucking points.
[tense music playing]
[Gasly] Sometimes, Formula 1 is not fair.
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.
I feel this is, like, extra small.
[Pyry] No, it's just pumped guns.
[machinery whirring]
[Gasly] But if I get knocked,
I just go back at it even harder.
-Radio check okay?
-[Hamelin] Radio is good.
[engine revving]
[Hamelin] <i>We go to the grid.</i>
<i>Please confirm.</i>
[Gasly] Copy.
When things piss you off,
me, I use this energy
to make me even stronger.
[Horner]
The situation with Alex is very clear.
He knows the pressure that he's under
to deliver a result.
He needs to get a little bit more
of that "fuck you" attitude
that you see the great drivers have.
[Albon] You know, as a Red Bull driver,
you need to perform
to… to kind of show
the big bosses, really,
that you're there to be in Formula 1.
[commentator 1] <i>Alex Albon starts ninth,</i>
<i>desperate to end this run without a podium</i>

[Hamelin] <i>We are checking.</i>
[crew members muttering]
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>Alex Albon getting it</i>
<i>all wrong at that first chicane</i>
{\an8}<i>and losing places as a result.</i>
[Albon] I've got no grip on these hards!
[Rennie] We've got a little bit

-[Albon] So, we're gonna be at the back?
-[Rennie] <i>We are currently P14.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Albon in</i>

[tense music playing]
{\an8}[Hamelin]
<i>Okay, Pierre, box, box. Box, box.</i>
<i>Torque one in the pitlane.</i>

<i>And that is a very big accident.</i>
[Gasly] Leclerc is out?
[Hamelin] <i>Confirmed. He went out.</i>
<i>Safety car. Safety car. Safety car!</i>
Okay, Pierre.
They are still clearing the track.
Pit-lane entry is closed at the moment.
I'll keep you posted.
[commentator 2] <i>The pit-lane entry</i>
<i>is closed, but Hamilton's coming in.</i>
[indistinct chattering]
[chuckling]
{\an8}[Gasly] Who pitted in front of us?
[Hamelin] Only Hamilton, but the pit lane
was closed, so he should have a penalty.
[commentator 2]
<i>Hamilton is under investigation</i>
<i>for pitting when the pit-lane entry</i>
<i>was closed.</i>
<i>And now, the pit-lane entry is open.</i>
[Hamelin] There will be some cars
in the pit exit. Everyone is boxing.
[Gasly] Copy.
[Hamelin] <i>This is pretty good for us.</i>
<i>This is pretty good for us.</i>
[Gasly] Copy.
[commentator 3] <i>So,</i>
<i>this has really changed the order round.</i>
<i>Pierre Gasly pitted way before,</i>
<i>so he's a massive gainer in this.</i>
[Hamelin] <i>Okay, Pierre,</i>

<i>You don't know in Formula 1.</i>
<i>You've got to take your opportunities.</i>
[Gasly] Winning a Formula 1 race
was one of my dreams
since I started to watch F1
when I was five years old.
But to win a Formula 1 race,
being in a midfield car,
you've got to risk everything.

We did it!
Yeah!
[cheering, excited yelling]
[Horner] You're as good as your last race
in this game,
so perceptions can change
very, very quickly.
Pierre has done an excellent job.
He's driving like he has nothing to lose.
[indistinct chattering]
[crew members cheer raucously]
[crew member] Number one!
[cheering continues]
[Rennie] <i>Okay, so, finishing order, uh,</i>
<i>was Gasly, Sainz, Stroll.</i>
<i>We were P15.</i>
[cheering in distance]
[Albon] Okay. Sorry, guys.
[Horner] Look… [sighs]
…the situation with Alex is very clear.
That race was a disaster for him,
so we need to see Alex
really grab that seat and make it his own.
The problem is if he doesn't,
then, you know,
we need to look outside and think,
"Okay, if Alex isn't gonna
make that next step,
who do we put alongside Max for 2021?"
[announcer] <i>Well done to Pierre Gasly!</i>
[crowd cheering, whistling]
[cheering]
[Gasly] This is such an amazing moment.
A moment I dreamed about
for so many years.
[cheering, whistling]
[cheering continues]
[Gasly] I just thought,
"Okay, we've done it."
"What more do I need to prove?"
[crew members] Oh…
[cheering, whooping]
I know, in life,
you… you have many obstacles.
[crew members cheering]
[Gasly] After the Red Bull demotion,
I had to face a big challenge.
I had to rebuild myself.
But it's only my third season in F1,
so I'm better than last year.
2021 is gonna be a better Pierre,
and 2022 is gonna be
an even better Pierre.
Ready to give my very best...
[cheering]
…to bring this team
as much success as I can.
[photographer] Let me get this done,
then you can go.
[Gasly] I need to call my parents as well.
Have you heard them? Fuck,
I cannot imagine how they are right now.
{\an8}[Steiner] What the fuck?
{\an8}The target for the season is to survive
as a team. [chuckling]
-It's a very expensive business.
-[man] Couldn't even do one lap!
[Steiner] We need new sponsorship deals.
I'm wheeling and dealing,
Gene, to stay alive.
The German sponsors want German drivers.
I will decide which driver goes this week.
{\an8}He needs to step it up.
If he doesn't, there are gonna be
some difficult decisions to be made.
[Gow] It's incredibly hard.
He doesn't want to leave Formula 1.
[Tim] <i>Stop the car. It's on fire.</i>
[dramatic music playing]For Americans,
to travel is difficult, you know?
-Lucky for you, isn't it?
-[Steiner] Fucking hell, yeah.
Yeah, I have to speak with him
every fucking day. He doesn't stop.
[phone ringing]
[Steiner] Hi, Gene.
I said to you, as long as we can afford
what you said to me,
I'm trying to… I'm doing my best
{\an8}The target for the season
is to survive… [laughs]
{\an8}…as a team.
Okay, gonna fix it, you know?
That is what we need to do
every day, Gene.
I'm wheeling and dealing at the moment,
to stay alive.
[producer] How do you sum up
your season this year?
It's one short word.
Shit! [chuckles]
What the fuck?
[Grosjean] Fucking hell. Who was that?
[commentator 1]
<i>Grosjean has something of a meltdown.</i>
[Steiner] Jesus Christ.

[commentator 4] <i>It seems so long ago</i>
<i>that Haas were celebrating.</i>
{\an8}You know, just week after week
after week of constantly losing
{\an8}is just not easy to do.
We can't keep running in the back.
I don't want to necessarily win,
but I want to be competitive
once in a while.
[Steiner] Thank you, bye.
Fucking hell.
If I don't do a… a good job,
I should be gone.
If you are not good enough,
you will be, uh, spat out.
Action.

[Steiner] Aah.
[practitioner] Keep "aah".
It's a good tone, that is.
[Steiner] Aah. [chuckles]
[Leclerc] Sorry.
[Daniel] There's always room for dessert.
I know, but some desserts,
like, let's be honest, ice cream,
you could just keep picking
and eat the whole tub.
-[Lando] I need a brolly.
-[woman] Want this one?
[Lando] Tim, where's my brolly?
-[Steiner] It's fully the sun now, huh?
-[man] Want an umbrella?
[Steiner] No, fuck off!
That would hurt my ego, you know.
[giggles]
Standing there with an umbrella…
-[man] Wouldn't do much for my ego either.
-[Steiner] Yeah, fucking hell.
"It's a little bit of sun
and I need an umbrella."
[trainer] Feet, touch the toes,
hold for five seconds,
back up, then carry on for another five.
[machinery whirring]
I think being a small team
has got its advantages and disadvantages.
One of the advantages,
it's more like everybody knows each other.
Like family.
[trainer] Big stretch
and then back again for five.
[Steiner] But I would say
it's a very dysfunctional family.
-[trainer] Cheers, guys. Thank you.
-[man 2] I'm knackered.
[laughs]
[Buxton] Haas has one
of the most stable operations in Formula 1
in terms of staff turnover.
{\an8}It's like Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.
[machinery whirring]
Nobody ever goes in,
nobody ever comes out.
Romain and Kevin have been with us
for, uh, for a long time now.

-[Kevin] Not too bad.

you become close with everyone.
[woman] <i>Well, we have five fans here.</i>
<i>They have questions for you both.</i>
[Kevin] I feel very happy here,

to Taylor Swift before the race.
-[laughter from computer]
-[Grosjean chuckles]
[Grosjean] I've spent five years
with Haas, wearing the colors.
{\an8}It's been… it's really good, you know?
[woman] <i>Kevin, what do you listen to?</i>
I kind of like to listen to,
like, old Danish rock music.
-[Grosjean] Not good!
-[chuckles]
[Grosjean] I've put a lot of effort,
a lot of passion and love into the team
uh, since… since day one
and always wanted us
to do better and better.
[Steiner] Where's the driver?
[man 4] He's on his way.
He's on his last interview.
[Steiner] At the moment,
I'm not happy where we are.
The car last year wasn't good
and this year, we're struggling as well,
so we, uh, need to refresh ourselves
and rethink everything
and see what we do going forward
for the mid-and long-term,
not the short term.
-[man 4] Hey, Romain. You all right?
-[Grosjean] Yeah.
-[man 4] How was your holiday?
-[Grosjean] Yeah, good. Yourself?
After a very strong 2018,
the team started going down,
racing for the last position.
Now, we have absolutely no chance
to be on the podium.
-[man 4] What about you? Do any drinking?
-[Grosjean] Yeah.
-Well, I put 2.5 kilos on, so must have!
-[man 4 laughs]
[Gannon] He should've come out right here
and overtaken Räikkönen,
instead, he came out miles behind.
[Kevin] You learn a lot from tough times,
but you also… you get a stronger bond
in the team between everyone, and…
and that will make us better in…
for the future.
[suspenseful music playing]
[man 5] As we've seen
after previous races,
it's very tight
between ourselves and Alfa,
so, obviously, the potential
to get out Q1 is there.
Um, and, obviously that's the main aim
for… for us in this respect.
Our main rivals, they are Alfa Romeo.
I think the rest of the midfield
is… is a touch too far ahead.
[Vasseur] Hi, Guenther!
If they're doing better,
I'm not getting upset.
Some you win, some you lose.
But I think they play always fair
and, uh, it's… for sure,
it's not good to… to lose against them.
I need to go to the press pen.
-[Vasseur] You have three minutes.
-[Steiner] Got it.
{\an8}Guenther is a colleague
and I am spending more time, uh,
{\an8}in my life
with my colleagues than with my wife!
And… [chuckles]
[Steiner] How many assistants
have you got?
I have nobody because I have no money.
You've got three people
running around you.
-[Vasseur] Yeah.
-[Steiner] Another one coming. Four now.
[Vasseur] We can fight on track,
on drivers,
but at the end,
we are doing the same business
and we can sit down together
and have a coffee.
[giggling]
[Steiner] You're so stupid, Fred!
Fred and myself
are in very similar positions.
We are, I would say,
the only independent teams now.
He's got an owner, I've got an owner,
so we compare the notes.
Haas and Alfa Romeo are incredibly close
competitors in all regards.
Not only do they share
the same engine provider,
but their annual budget
is probably around the same figure.
But Alfa Romeo
have world champion Kimi Räikkönen.
[cheering]
[commentator]
<i>Here's your 2007 world champion,</i>
<i>Kimi Räikkönen.</i>
{\an8}I'm Kimi Räikkönen
and I drive for Alfa Romeo Racing.
[serene music playing]
[Gow] Kimi Räikkönen is
a valuable commodity.
{\an8}He's got the expertise, the consistency,
{\an8}a little bit more experience
he can bring to the team.
And he's keeping his seat for 2021.
[man over computer] <i>So, I do the countdown</i>
<i>and then, if you'd like to smile.</i>
<i>Three, two, one.</i>
<i>Thanks a lot.</i>
But he's a funny character
to try and read.
[producer] Are you a fan of interviews?
Never been.
Still not so.
In the other seat
is one of Ferrari's junior drivers,
Antonio Giovinazzi.
[in Italian] Hello.
[Buxton in English]
The first Italian driver in Formula 1 for…
a good long time.
[man over computer]
<i>Give me your smile in three, two, one.</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>
[video call ringing]
{\an8}-[man] Giovinazzi!
-[woman] <i>Ciao</i>!
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Antonio in Italian] <i>Hello.</i>
-[man] All good?
[Antonio]<i> Yes.</i>
<i>I can't see you, Giovinazzi.</i>
I'm here. Good evening.
[family giggling]
{\an8}[in English]
The first thing when my mom saw me,
{\an8}is always,
"You look so skinny, you need to eat."
[in Italian] What will you eat tonight?
[Antonio] <i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe rice, salmon and avocado.</i>
[Antonio in English] We were,
you know, a small family
from a town in south of Italy
called Martina Franca.
[producer] Are you, uh,
a bit of a hero in Martina Franca?
Yes, yes, yes.
[man in Italian]
Are you going out on your bike?
<i>Yes. Sometimes I cycle.</i>
<i>The weather is nice over here.</i>
[Antonio in English] I'm proud
to bring back the Italian flag
in the Formula 1 grid.
Of course, also a little bit of pressure
because I'm the only one.
So, I want to do well for them,
uh, but yeah, just, uh, in the end,
I'm just really proud.
[mom in Italian] Are you tired?
[Antonio] <i>Uh, I will eat and go to bed.</i>
[man] Perfect.
Okay, take care. Goodbye.
<i>-Good night. Bye.</i>
-[family] Bye. Good night. Bye.
He's… he's wicked quick, Antonio.
[thrilling music playing]
But he has some sort
of wild and wacky moments
where he loses control of the car.
And it's a surprise
that they keep him on, really, for 2020.
And finish.
Starting with this one.
[Antonio] For me,
the main thing this season
is that I show to my boss my talent.
It's my dream to score a podium with them.
You know, an Italian driver, in, uh…
with an Italian brand
like Alfa Romeo in a podium,
so this is my dream.
Everybody is supportive behind him
to try to get the best from… from Antonio.
But at the end, you have to perform
and if you don't do it,
you will lose your seat.
That's life.
[commentator 1] <i>Hello, everyone.</i>
<i>It's time for the British Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Haas have a lot to prove.</i>
[engine revving, tires squealing]
[commentator 1] <i>Guenther Steiner</i>
<i>will be feeling the pressure.</i>
A small team like ours
is supported by investors
and in times like this,
they doubt everything.
[aircraft whirring]
There's a lot on the table,
but it… it is not anything
that a great race could be changed.
[Keedle] RG hasn't finished
the last five Grand Prix here.
I just fucking want him
to finish the race.
{\an8}-[Haines] <i>Radio check, Romain.</i>
-[Grosjean] Yeah, radio is very good.
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Becker] <i>Radio check, loud and clear.</i>
-[Antonio] Yeah, loud and clear.
{\an8}[Gannon] <i>Okay, Kevin, have a great race.</i>

<i>We're racing at Silverstone.</i>
<i>Magnussen has already passed Albon.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>Magnussen going</i>
<i>wheel to wheel with Pierre Gasly.</i>
[Kevin] If you back off
in a Formula 1 race,
especially on that first lap,
you'll get overtaken so easily.
[Gannon] <i>Great job.</i>
[Kevin] You can't give away too much.
[commentator 2]
<i>Whoa, there's a huge crash there.</i>
[Steiner] Ah, fuck.
[commentator 2] <i>Oh my goodness me!</i>
[man 1] He didn't even do one lap!
{\an8}[Grosjean] Is Kevin okay?
{\an8}[Haines] <i>Yeah, Kevin's okay.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Poor old Magnussen,</i>
<i>ending up in the gravel trap.</i>
<i>It's not what you want.</i>
[Becker] <i>Keep pushing</i>

[exciting electronic music playing]
[Becker] Antonio, we are currently P13.
{\an8}<i>And behind, we have Grosjean.</i>
{\an8}[Haines] <i>This is awesome, dude.</i>
<i>Really good pace here.</i>
{\an8}[Grosjean]
Yeah, I'm pushing as hard as I can.
[commentator 2] <i>He could drive himself</i>

{\an8}<i>-</i>[Becker] <i>Box this lap.</i>

[commentator 2] <i>A lot of drivers pitting.</i>
<i>Everybody pouring into the pits.</i>
<i>Apart from Romain Grosjean.</i>
[man 2] Fucking just pit
when everyone else pits!
Fucking hell!
{\an8}[Grosjean] I'm focusing on time right now.
Get as many positions as I can.
[commentator 2] <i>So, crucially,</i>
<i>that's put him into the top five,</i>
<i>but he's going to be really slow</i>
<i>on those old tires.</i>
[Grosjean] Okay, boys.
The front left is really struggling.
[Keedle] Fuck's sake!
[commentator 2] <i>Sainz is right</i>
<i>on the back of the Haas.</i>
{\an8}[Becker] <i>Good job so far.</i>
<i>Keep pushing, Antonio.</i>
<i>We slightly closed the gap</i>

{\an8}[Grosjean]
I really don't know what I can do.
[commentator 2]

[Grosjean] The rear tires,
they're going on me.
[Steiner] Please tell him,
"just stay calm." Calm him down.

[Grosjean] Are you kidding?

[Grosjean] What the fuck?
[commentator 2]
<i>Can't believe what I've just seen!</i>
[Steiner] Fuck!
[Grosjean] Why couldn't I engage first?
[Haines] <i>We will check.</i> <i>We will check.</i>
-[man 1] We're last now.
-[man 2] We are fucking last.
[commentator 2] <i>Not been a good weekend</i>

{\an8}[Becker] <i>Good job, Antonio. We are P14.</i>
The last two corners. Good job.

[Becker] <i>Well done. Excellent race.</i>
[Antonio] Yeah, thank you very much.
[commentator 2] <i>And here's Grosjean,</i>
<i>limping home, plumb last.</i>
[Haines] <i>Yeah, dude, that's the checker.</i>
[Grosjean] I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry.
[Steiner] Normally,
when you drive into the pit,
you go straight to first gear.
He went into neutral.
He fucked it up, you know.
It's his fault, yeah.
[man 2] Oh well,
I guess we weren't getting points anyway.
[man 4] No.
[commentator 2] <i>Tough times now</i>
<i>for Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.</i>
[phone ringing]
[Steiner] Fucking hell.
[clears throat]
Hi, Gene. Did you watch us?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, front and rear suspension
is for sure broken.
Fucking hell.
And did you see with Romain?
No, no, no, no, no.
He fucked the pit stop up.
Otherwise we would have finished 11th,
Gene, 10th or 11th.
We would have been in front of Vettel.
{\an8}No. No. No.
[Gene] <i>I don't want to spend more money</i>
<i>on this team at the moment.</i>
<i>You need to find a sponsor.</i>
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
All right, Gene. No.
I'll speak with you in the week.
Thank you, Gene.
Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.
I think, for sure, uh,
Gene was not happy with the results.
It's a very expensive business.
Money is, uh, less than it was before.
There is less income.
So, we need to find outside financing
to survive as a team.
[ominous music playing]
[Maempel in German]
The presentation is ready now.
How did you say you were gonna do it?
-[Maempel] I don't have my adapter.
-They must have an adapter there.
{\an8}I was thinking
we say this is 15 million US dollars.
{\an8}As long as I have the $15 million,
I'm okay.
[in English] On the sponsor side,
there's a negotiation
with a very well-known company
in Germany in the tech business,
and that is the partners you want.
It's very stressful, but I think
Gene trusts me that I can pull it off.
{\an8}[car horns honking]
[Maempel in German]
Let's just walk and say hello.
-[man 1] Hello, Mr. Steiner.
-[Steiner] Afternoon.
[in English] We need sponsors
to keep going with the team.
If a partner comes aboard, that would mean
somebody shares the cost of going racing
and we would be more than happy.
[in German] The drivers have also sent you
a little greeting
and I got it signed by both Haas drivers.
[man 2] Personally signed?
Great, thank you.
[all chuckling]
-A warm welcome here.
-Thank you.
It is important to me
that we are included along the way.
And the question here is,
how can you include us
so we will learn to trust the team?
[Steiner in English]
The sponsorship doesn't come as easy
as saying, "Sponsor me," you know.
For sure there will be mandates to follow.
[man 3 in German] Maybe
it's not just the sponsor that's new,
but maybe you also have a German driver.
This is enormously important for us.
[Steiner in English] Sponsors nowadays,
they want to have a little bit
of influence also in the drivers.
So, there is a lot to decide
and to weigh up against each other.
What is the best to do?
And, uh, it needs some thinking
and, uh,
to… to make the right strategic decision.
[in German] I don't want to promise
anything I can't do.
I can… I'm not saying it's a yes, but…
I mean, there are possibilities, you know.
[tense music playing]
-[man 3] Okay, great.
-[Steiner] Thank you.
Bye. See you next time. Bye. Thank you.
Thank you for your time.
Bye. Thank you.
[pensive music playing]
[in English] The easiest would be
to have tons of money,
just keep the same two drivers
and keep on going
and, uh, have no worries,
but there is a… a team
which needs to be kept alive
with the best talent
and the best finances possible.
It's quite a big responsibility.
There is sometimes tough decisions.
Will be very difficult for me to do,
to tell Romain or Kevin it's over.
They will be upset.
They are part of the family.
[classical music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>The big news this weekend</i>
<i>is that Mick Schumacher,</i>
<i>rising star of Formula 2</i>
<i>and son of seven-time world champion</i>
<i>Michael Schumacher,</i>
<i>is here.</i>
[Gow] Mick Schumacher could be the answer
to most of Guenther Steiner's problems.
[Steiner] <i>Ciao.</i>
Morning. How are you?
[Gow] But…
Fred Vasseur at Alfa Romeo
is a very shrewd operator.
He also sees the kind of cash cow
that Mick Schumacher could be in his team.
Okay, that's fun.
[commentator 1]
<i>Mick Schumacher crosses the line</i>
<i>to win for the first time in Formula 2</i>
{\an8}I'm Mick Schumacher, I'm 21 years old,
{\an8}and I'm a racing driver.
{\an8}My dad is Michael Schumacher.
He's seven-time world champion
and he's the greatest.
My dad is my idol, that's for sure.
Obviously, my goal is F1.
[crowd cheering]
There are two teams
which haven't, uh, announced
their driver lineup yet,
which are Alfa Romeo and Haas.
So, yeah, we'll have to see.
I'm here now this weekend with Alfa Romeo,
just to get the insights to feel,
"Okay, how does a racing team
really work on a race weekend?"
I wonder if I printed enough.
Never had this many people. [chuckles]
There's a lot of rumors
surrounding the team.
Um, driver market and...
We're not focusing on any of those.
We're just focusing on doing our job.
[Antonio] Of course I know.
I'm not stupid.
I know that Mick is there
and Mick is doing well in Formula 2.
He is not my main focus now.
My main focus is, uh, is doing well,
and I'm sure if I'm doing well, I will,
uh, I will be still here next year.
[Vasseur] I knew that Mick was part
of the Ferrari Driver Academy.
I was already watching him in,
um, in F3,
two years ago or three years ago.
I'm a competitor.
We always want to get more.
If you are happy with what you have,
then you are dead.
[machinery whirring]
[Steiner] Mick is wearing
an Alfa Romeo jacket this weekend,
which doesn't mean
he's next year in Alfa Romeo.
Doesn't mean anything.
[Steiner] Gene, I'm working on the deal
as we said, you need to trust me on that.
Having a German driver
for a German sponsor,
obviously, is crucial.
[Gene] <i>Mick Schumacher's coming in? No.</i>
[Gene speaking indistinctly]
[Steiner] Because he's very sellable,
you know, and that's what my point is.
If I've got Schumacher,
I think I can find some more money, Gene.
<i>-</i>[Gene] <i>It's good to have money.</i>
-[Steiner] Yeah.
So, if… if we get Schumacher,
I think I can… I can find some.
I hope three million.
Between three and five million more.
So, we have got a very good budget,
you know.
[machinery whirring]
Mick, by winning the F2 championship,
for sure, is a hot property.
And with Mick, the other attraction is,
uh, we all know who his father is.
But what can be done? I don't know yet.
-[helicopter blades whirring]
-[suspenseful music playing]
[announcer] <i>But again the pace</i>
<i>of Rafaele Marciello...</i>
[in Italian] These days, for young boys...
[announcer]
<i>...Albert Costa off the race track</i>.
...it is impossible to make it into F1.
[announcer continues indistinctly]
You need to think of the future.
Put some money aside
and think about another activity.
[Steiner in English] I don't know
the talks Mick had with Fred.
I don't know that,
but I just cannot wait around.
[Maempel in German] Let's do it this week.
I want to use the momentum.
No, we have to do it this week.
I have the offer on the table.
I just have to negotiate the numbers
with him.
[in English] I try to do the best
and try to make my point, why…
why he should come to us,
and… and… and work on the deal.
[in German]
I should get a relatively quick answer.
Hopefully,
he will say this is okay for him.
[Steiner] Okay, let's do that.
A race is starting at two,
then I can't sit here
and be filmed by Netflix, you know.
Then I won't have a job anymore.
[chuckles]
[machinery whirring]
[Kevin in English]
The situation is strange
when you have no idea
what's going to happen.
I have a very, very strong feeling
the team is going to change one of us.
[tense music playing]
[Grosjean] I believe the future
is always in your hands.
But, obviously,
I am not the one making the decision.
[Gannon] <i>Radio check, Kevin.</i>
There has been competition from day one
with Kevin.
He's tough on track.
[engine revving]
[Grosjean] The decision to, you know,
get rid of Kevin or myself…
[engine revving]
Put some oil on the fire.
[cars zooming]
[in Italian] If you want to go fast
at this one, you've got to have balls.
You've got to have balls
and you've got to know the track.

{\an8}[Grosjean] Obviously heavy traffic.
Impossible to overtake.
[Steiner] Maybe we tell Romain
he's doing the same time
as the guys in front of him
just to keep
his, you know, spirit up, yeah.
{\an8}[Haines] <i>Pace is really good.</i>
<i>You're matching Gasly ahead.</i>

[commentator 3]
<i>Räikkönen to the inside of Russell.</i>

<i>That'll be the end of Russell's afternoon.</i>
[Russell] Oh my word. What happened there?
[Ayao] <i>Safety car. Safety car.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>We've got a virtual safety car deployed</i>
<i>and as a result of that,</i>
<i>this could be pit-stop time.</i>
[Becker] Box, box.
{\an8}[Antonio] Copy.
[Steiner] Somehow we need to tell Romain
that if he can do it on a one-stop,
we have points, you know.
{\an8}[Haines] <i>How's it going?</i>
{\an8}[Grosjean] I think tires are still okay.
[Haines] We are thinking
of a variation on Plan B.
[Grosjean] Okay,
think and I'll drive fast.
[commentator 3] <i>While most of the drivers</i>

you're gonna be in free air,
so let's push on these tires
and get 'em going.

[Gannon]
<i>Okay, Kevin, currently you're P12.</i>
{\an8}<i>Romain's P10 on his one-stop,</i>

Great job, Romain.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you for never giving up.
{\an8}[Grosjean] Yeah,
that's not something we do, giving up.
[Steiner] We needed this, huh?
We needed this.
[indistinct chattering]
[Grosjean] For the whole team,
scoring two points
was a bloody cool moment.
It felt really good, you know. Uh…
For us, P9 is… is the absolute best
on a… on a really good day.
[Enrico in Italian] Nice one, good work.
Well done.
We beat everyone that we needed to beat.
[gleeful yelling]
-[man] Fucking awesome.
-[Steiner] Where's your broken finger?
-[Grosjean] Here, getting better, but…
-[Steiner] Yeah. Is it broken?
[Grosjean] No. Hey, hey, hey!
It's not broken, but it's blue.
[indistinct chattering, laughter]
[Grosjean] Let's go. Let's go.
My new job! [giggles]
{\an8}-All right, so, forward planning.
-[Steiner] Forward planning.
{\an8}-What do you know?
-[Steiner] What do I know?
[Stuart] What do you know?
What can you tell me?
Where are the balls in the air?
-[Stuart] Circus.
-Circus, yeah. Clowns.
Circus. Formula 1.
So, anyway,
I will decide which driver goes this week.
You know, it will be quite emotional.
You know, in an ideal world,
my plan would be
that we make that official
the Portugal weekend.
[tense music playing]
[Steiner] You want my job?
Wouldn't take the pay cut.
[chuckling]
[Buxton] Okay. Three, two, uh, one.
Formula 1 arrives in Portimao
for the 2020 Portuguese Grand Prix
and a driver market
has been kicked into overdrive.
[camera shutter clicking]
[Buxton] Just this morning,
the Haas F1 team announced
that not one…
but both of their drivers
would be leaving the team
at the end of this season.
[somber music playing]
[Kevin] In a way, exciting as well,
but mostly weird.
[Grosjean] Gonna miss the feeling
of Formula 1.
[Kevin] Hello.
[Buxton] Well, news.
Uh, when were you informed,
or was it a decision that was made
between you and the team?
Guenther called me a week ago or so,
um, to tell me that
they were, uh, gonna go for other drivers.
Maybe I'm ignorant,
but I… I felt pretty confident…
[chuckling] …that they'd keep me.
You know, Formula 1 can be a cold place,
uh…
a lot of the time.
[Stuart] Anyhoo…
Yeah, I mean, bottom line is
everyone knows you're gonna
drive the absolute nuts off of this car
until the end of the season.
-You won't take your foot off the gas.
-[Kevin] Absolutely.
But I will always, you know, look back
and… and be disappointed
that I didn't become a world champion.
You know, yes, I'm sad
about not being able to continue,
but I think it's overwhelmingly…
You know, I'm more grateful than sad
about things, you know.
-[Buxton] Thanks, Kevin.
-Thank you.
[Grosjean] I'm not really done
with Formula 1,
but maybe Formula 1's done with me.
It's not good for me.
It was, you know,
um, collateral damage, if you want, but,
uh, you know, nothing I can say.
Uh, fair enough. I understand.
Uh, and, uh, we move on.
[Steiner] Uh, to make a decision
to let people go,
it's never a nice thing to do
and, for sure,
somebody's feelings get hurt.
But especially with Romain and Kevin,
they got to be friends.
It is not easy,
but all good things have, uh, an end.
[Steiner clears throat]
I just have to say hello to him.
-Are you still saying hello to me?
-[Grosjean] Huh?
-[Steiner] Still saying hello?
-Yeah.
[Steiner] I know that, yeah.
I'm just joking.
It seems to have been managed
pretty good, you know.
As we said, we are not damaging anybody.
That's the last thing I want to do.
You know that I mean that.
-Because otherwise…
-[Grosjean] For sure.
-[Steiner] It's never nice, but hey.
-[Grosjean] Yeah.
[Steiner] Life is not <i>ein Wunschkonzert,</i>
as we say in German.
You know? Fucking hell, yeah.
[tense music playing]
[producer] You've got rid
of your sort of two adopted sons.
Uh, so, what's next? Who's coming in?
You're persisting to try to find out
which direction we are going. [laughs]
[commentator 1] <i>Venturing into</i>
<i>a Formula 1 weekend for the first time…</i>
<i>Mick Schumacher.</i>
Next year, we'll have Mick Schumacher
and, uh, Nikita Mazepin as our drivers.
[edgy music playing]
[Steiner] Nikita Mazepin
is one of the talented drivers
in Formula 2 this year
and, uh, his father, he has got
a very successful company as well,
which he may want to promote.
-[Mick] Hi.
-[woman] Hello.
-[man] Congratulations.
-[Mick] Thank you.
[Steiner] I was pretty happy
that the rumor mill
was that Mick is going to Alfa
because that distracted
the real negotiations, you know?
[chuckling]
[reporter] It was announced that
Mick Schumacher's gonna be in the car.
Why did you pick Mick?
It's going to be tough for a rookie
next year, isn't it?
I'm sure there will be criticism.
"Two rookies cannot work."
It will be very difficult.
I know the challenge in front of us,
but because nobody has ever done it,
it doesn't mean that it's wrong.
No risk, no fun! [snickers]
{\an8}-[Gow] Sainz is going to Ferrari.
-[notification chimes]
-[man] How much are you gonna miss him?
-[Lando] Uh…
[Gow] How is this relationship
going to continue?
[Tom] <i>Okay, Carlos.</i>
<i>No fight with Lando. Let him go.</i>
[Sainz] Fucking hell.
[Lando] He just turned in on me.
What's he trying to do?
{\an8}I'm pretty angry.
{\an8}[commentator] <i>A very, very nasty crash.</i>
-[Gannon] <i>Red flag.</i>
<i>-</i>[panicked yelling]
[Steiner] Once you see fire,
that's the worst thing you can have.
You don't think anybody can get out alive
of this one.
[electronic music playing][outgoing call tone]
-[Sainz] Hola.
<i>-Hola. Uh, buenas noches.</i>
[Sainz] <i>Who am I speaking with?</i>
Um, you are speaking… You don't know?
[chuckles] Are you joking?
-[Sainz] <i>Who am I talking to? Come on.</i>
-Uh, it's Lando! [laughs]
-[Sainz] <i>Lando!</i>
<i>-</i>[giggles]
[rock music playing]
[man 1] You and Carlos, as we know,
have struck up a very close bond
with lots of banter
in your relationship as teammates.
We kinda went into the first time meeting
and that was how it all started.
[raucous laughter]
[giggling]
-Been doing well, this <i>cabrón, </i>lately.
-This <i>cabrón! </i>This <i>cabrón!</i>
So we're gonna spend
some more... some more time together.
[both yell, giggle]
[Lando] It's been good for me, um,
obviously, learning from a guy with,
with such experience.
Guacamole.
[Lando] Guacamoley.
No. "Moley". No.
-[Lando] Guacamoley.
-No.
[man 2] You seem to be
the best pairing in the paddock.
-Get to the chopper!
-[giggles]
[Sainz] I think we have the right balance.
We're sharing good moments together.
Ooh!
[man 1] How much are you gonna miss him
when he does move to Ferrari next year?
-[Lando] Uh…
-[Sainz] Hmm…
-[notification whistles]
-[reporter] <i>Big news out of Italy.</i>
<i>In a surprise move,</i>
<i>Carlos Sainz has decided to leave</i>
<i>his Formula 1 family, McLaren,</i>
<i>at the end of the year</i>
<i>to join Ferrari for the 2021 season.</i>
[Buxton] The silly season of driver moves
is happening
in the early part of the season.
Carlos has got to go through
the entire season with his team and Lando
knowing that, at the end of the year,
they're gonna part ways.
It could be very difficult for him.
-[engine revving]
-[distant cheering, whistling]
[Sainz in Spanish] Shall we go?
{\an8}Let's go.
[in English] Last year, I'm very happy
with my success at McLaren.
<i>-</i>[Tom] <i>Yes!</i>
<i>-</i>Wow!
<i>-</i>[Tom] <i>Great job, mate.</i>
-[Sainz] Can't believe it, guys.
It's probably been
my strongest year in F1,
so it makes me feel proud and happy.
[cheering]
[Sainz Sr.] That's good.
{\an8}[Sainz in Spanish] Mulligan. How bad.
[in English] Fore left.
[Sainz Sr.] Ah!
<i>Carlos has achieved</i>
<i>so many things in Formula 1.</i>
<i>Especially this last year.</i>
<i>I'm very proud of him.</i>
-[in Spanish] Let's go.
-Advantage Jon Rahm.
[Sainz Sr.] No, I am Jon Rahm.
Who do you want to be?
Choose.
[Sainz] Today, I am…
Rickie Fowler.
[in English] It will be hard
to leave McLaren next year,
but I think being a Ferrari driver
is one of the most special things
in Formula 1.
It's on the checklist
of pretty much every driver.
I've got the opportunity to do it.
[in Spanish] This part is very tense.
[upbeat music playing]
Come on!
[Sainz Sr. in English] <i>I believe that</i>
<i>Carlos will achieve many great things.</i>
Good shot.
-[in Spanish] Did it cross over?
-Yeah.
[Sainz Sr. in English]
<i>But Formula 1 is a tough business</i>
<i>and Carlos has seen some tough times.</i>
[Sainz] Nice look at birdie.
[Sainz Sr. in Spanish] Oi! Gentlemen!
Rickie Fowler has just messed up.
[in English]
<i>He needs to make sure he keeps focused</i>
<i>and he will not have any problem</i>
<i>to find his way to the top.</i>
[in Spanish]
You should have been Ian Poulter.
[tense music playing]
{\an8}Carlos got the opportunity
to go to Ferrari.
But this is a business,
so we'll have to get on with it.
[Tim] I think,
looking back over the last week,
it's sad to see Carlos going.
But the media, definitely, um,
{\an8}I think the Seb news was the thing
that took them by surprise.
[Zak] Mm.
How Seb divorced Ferrari,
that's not very pretty. I think--
Carlos has been doing…
We did agree,
"Let's get a few interviews done."
"We know people are asking about Ferrari,
but let's get interviews out of the way."
So, by the time we get to Austria,
that story's now covered,
we can get back to racing
and he can talk about the rest of the year
with us, which is what he wants.
[Gow] He's leaving McLaren.
{\an8}How is this working relationship
even going to continue,
{\an8}with McLaren knowing
that Sainz is going to Ferrari?
{\an8}[Zak] What's going on, dude?
{\an8}<i>-Hey, Mr. Brown. What's happening?</i>
-How are you?
<i>-Good to see you. Yeah. All good.</i>
-Good.
I, uh, I talked to Carlos earlier.
<i>It's strange also for the team.</i>
<i>We discussed it also with Tom already.</i>
<i>Uh, obviously knowing that he's leaving</i>
<i>at the end of the year,</i>
<i>so at some point the normal rules</i>
<i>of engagement will come into...</i>
<i>into action</i>
<i>with not giving him all the information</i>
<i>anymore etc..</i>
[Buxton] When somebody is leaving
to go and race for a rival,
you don't want them to take
all of the knowledge
{\an8}that you are going to try and use
to beat that team with in the future.
{\an8}So, yeah, it's... it's only normal
that a racing driver starts
to get marginalized in his own team
when it's already known
that he's off to a rival.

<i>Austria is a stunning country.</i>

<i>I can't see this drying out</i>

-[Zak] Everyone good?
-[man] <i>Yeah. You?</i>
Yeah, good.
[woman] <i>Do you think that McLaren</i>

[Zak] I hope so. I hope so.
We're gonna give it a go.
We did it last time.
-If anyone gets it, it might be this guy.
-[man] <i>Lando!</i>
-[Lando] Hello.
-You're way more excited to see him.
[man] <i>Lando!</i>
Lando came out of the gates,
uh, very strong
and he had an, uh, awesome first race,
and I'm... I'm very proud.
See ya.
[Zak] He showed a tremendous amount
of speed, a lot of racecraft.
Everything that we said,
"Here's what 2020 needs to look like."
<i>-</i>[man] <i>Hello.</i>
<i>-</i>[man 2] <i>Tony, show Lando your car!</i>
[Lando] Nice.
I've had a very good start to 2020,
{\an8}scoring my first podium in Formula 1
in the first race of the season.
-Woo-hoo-hoo!
-[cheering]
[Lando] Yes!
It was a dream start.
Something I never dreamt of,
kind of thing.
[Gow] I think Lando's success
in the first race
caught everybody by surprise,
especially Carlos.
[Buxton] McLaren's moving
in a new and exciting direction
led by Zak Brown.
I think Lando lies at the heart of it.
[Gow] Zak loves Lando Norris.
It's almost like
a father-son relationship.
Lando sits at the very center
of everything Zak wants McLaren to be.
[commentator]
<i>It's still incredibly wet out,</i>
<i>but it's now within the bounds</i>
<i>of the drivers to be able to go out.</i>
[machinery whirring]
[Sainz] Lando did a very good first race.
He managed to finish third
and I finished P5.
It actually was very close,
because I was coming from behind
and I had a chance to overtake him
and didn't quite make it stick.
I mean, if I had known it was for
a podium, I think I would have made it.
Myself and Carlos,
we've always had a, a good friendship.
But last year, I was a rookie.
There was a lot of slack.
Whereas this year, I'm pushing him more,
and I guess that's never something
that you wanna see your teammate do.
[Buxton] In 2019,
Lando Norris was in his rookie season.
This year,
Lando's a much more confident racer
than he was.
[engineer]
<i>Green light in two minutes. Two minutes.</i>
[Sainz] My self-confidence as a driver
tells me that I am prepared
to lead this team.
I want to be on top.

to let the other driver through,
it's only because we think
that's the faster car.
{\an8}[Lando] Appreciate it, guys.
Instead of it being me
having to let him go

<i>He's obviously gonna move to the Scuderia.</i>
<i>Can't back out now, can you?</i>
The team let Lando overtake me. So, uh,
I am pretty angry right now. [chuckles]
I don't really show
a lot of anger and rage,
mainly because
I'm not that kind of character.
At some point, I always end up,
I don't know, throwing a glove
or just a small gesture.
If I do some kind of that,
it shows that I'm really, really angry.
I just, I'm just taking it inside.
-Where am I sitting? There?
-[Lando] Oh! Damn!
-Just dried his seat for him.
-[Sainz] He's contaminated it.
[Sainz snickers]
[Lando]
He's actually just injured me, mate.
[Sainz] Uh, yeah?
Let me see. Can I take care of it?
-[Lando] Shut up.
-Can I massage it?
[Lando] Just get to Ferrari already, mate.
In some ways, it's already kinda started,
the little bit of a tail-off,
um, with him obviously going
to Ferrari next year.
Carlos, one. Lando, zero.
Thing is I'm gonna do something to him,
and he's gonna get real--
-[Sainz] I never get angry with you.
-Yeah, you do.
-[Sainz] No, I'm not--
-You do.
[Sainz] There's never hard feelings.
[Buxton] Last year, Carlos and Lando
had this... had this real bromance,
and that's very rare in Formula 1.
This year is very different.

[Sainz in Spanish]
At the press conference,
they always ask...
They always ask me what car I drive.
They say, "Pagani? Porsche? Ferrari?"
"McLaren?"
"McLaren." And I say, "Golf!"
[Carlos Sr. chuckles]
[Sainz in English]
Every professional athlete needs
their own time.
My family has always been next to me.
It's where I feel the most comfortable.
[in Spanish] Come on.
Let's get going quick no?
-Come on.
-It's windy, isn't it?
[in English] He doesn't want
to spend much time stretching.
When he's here,
in a way, he's recharging batteries.
[in Spanish] You ready?
[Carlos Sr. chuckles]
[in English] The life
of the Formula 1 driver is not easy.
Motorsport is like that.
Motorsport is up and down.
And to have somebody you know
you can trust is, uh, super crucial.
Okay.
[Sainz Sr. in Spanish] Terrible!
[Carlos Sr. in English]
When things go wrong,
you need to be honest with yourself.
[both groan]
Learn from the bad things,
and if you need to cry, you cry,
but learn, make the mistakes,
trust in your talent, trust in your ideas,
trust the way you want to do things.
You suddenly start to think
in a different way on a few things,
and then you are changing your approach.
You change as a person, you know,
and then, suddenly,
you make a step in your career.
You must try to analyze,
and then turn the page, fully committed,
fully concentrated in the next race.
[indistinct exclamation]
I think it's the right approach.
[thrilling music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Good morning, everybody.</i>
<i>It's the Italian Grand Prix,</i>
<i>and here we are at Monza.</i>
<i>This is the temple of speed,</i>
<i>and the home of Ferrari.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Speeds today</i>
<i>in excess of 215 miles an hour.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>The streets, usually adorned</i>
<i>with thousands</i>
<i>of Ferrari's passionate fans,</i>
<i>or Tifosi,</i>
<i>as they're affectionately called.</i>
<i>This year, mostly watching</i>
<i>from the safety of their own homes.</i>
[commentator 4]
<i>You can see how passionate they are.</i>
<i>There's a hotel close to the track</i>
<i>a lot of drivers stay at.</i>
<i>You can see, there was evidence</i>
<i>of a lot of them standing there</i>
<i>trying to get a glimpse of their heroes.</i>
Hey, guys.
[camera shutters clicking]
-[camera shutter clicks]
<i>-Grazie.</i>
[cameras shutters clicking]
[Sainz] See you there.
Ooh, Tifosi!
[in Spanish] Wave at them.
[in English] Ferrari is known
for having that extra pressure.
It's nearly like a religion here in Italy.
We're gonna have a lot of time
and a lot of opportunities.
[in Italian] Thank you so much.
[in English] Tifosi, the media, everyone
is expecting Ferrari to be winning.
If they're not winning, there's pressure.
-[woman] <i>Buongiorno.</i>
-Ciao.
[woman in Italian] Go ahead.
[Caco in English] I think that adds
a bit more pressure to the drivers.
[crowd chanting]
Ferrari! Ferrari! Ferrari!
[Zak] In Monza,
I think,
if you have any affiliation with Ferrari,
whether you're a current driver
or going to be there,
there's probably, uh,
an increased intensity to it.
-[man] Carlos!
-[Sainz] Hi.
[Zak] Carlos probably feels
a little bit of the pressure.
He's soon gonna be a Ferrari driver,
so that puts a big spotlight on you.
But, uh, for sure,
Lando's performance this year,
and, uh, Carlos's bad luck along the way,
won't be, uh, putting him
in the happiest of moods at all times.
-[server] Macchiato. There's the tea.
-[Joseph] Thank you very much. Thank you.
[indistinct chattering]
[Joseph] So, compared to Lando,
this was his fastest through turn one,
compared to our fastest from turn one.
You can see he's challenging the fronts
just as much in this phase.
But his style is that he won't extend
holding the brake here.
Because he always just programs himself to
come off the brakes the same each corner.
It's just the subtle difference
in that he's got the tow here.
You've not quite got it.
[engine revving]
We're not asking you
to adopt Lando's approach to the braking.
-It's how we optimize your approach.
-Yeah.
I think any time things don't go your way
for a driver, you get disappointed.
It's a… It's a very emotional,
passionate, uh, sport.
There's times
the drivers make some mistakes.
[Sainz] My father taught me
to be hard-working,
to have the right attitude.
Without hard work, dedication,
it's pretty much impossible
to get to where you want.
[Gow] Carlos desperately needs
a good race.
He knows the Tifosi will welcome him
with open arms
if he can have a great race in Italy.
[Sainz] Every time you arrive to a track,
you know you are gonna be
part of their family next year.
That feeling is difficult to explain.
And it's part of why I'm so excited
about going to Ferrari.
All 20 drivers on the grid
have a similar level of talent that I do.
So there's only two things then that
you can control, which is your fitness,
but also be as mentally well-prepared
and self-confident as you can.

[Sainz] Oh!

Thank you, guys.
We tried our best, I think.
Thank you. Amazing weekend.
I'm actually very, very happy, and…
Um, yeah, particularly proud
of what I have achieved.
[cheering, applause]
I think there is a part of Carlos
that probably
would love to stay at McLaren.
[crowd cheering]
[announcer] <i>In second place, Carlos Sainz!</i>
[Lando] Ferrari, last year,
they were still podium contenders.
Now, you would say,
in some of the races, they've been
seventh-best team.
And you would say
it's one of the worst decisions
you could possibly make.
He probably is regretting it.
Um, even if he says he's not,
he probably is.
[crowd cheering, applauding]
[Sainz] Already starting to feel
what it's gonna be like next year,
and that is a feeling that no one's
gonna be able to take away from me.
Going to Ferrari, it's something that…
It's impossible to regret.
[indistinct chattering in background]
[man] How much are you gonna miss him
when he moves to Ferrari next year?
Say it. Yes, you're gonna miss me.
Say it now.
-You can't force me to say it.
-Yeah. Say it.
When I'm passing him on the racetrack,
I can wave at him.
[both chuckle]
{\an8}[Romain] Can't find a team.
{\an8}-Everyone is booked?
-Yeah.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Big weekend</i>

Just a reminder about the track limits.
[producer] Think you'll be here next year?
Don't know.
I know what I need to do.
I want that seat more than anyone.
Just a couple of last-minute reminders.
The wind has picked up a bit.
[Pérez] Formula 1, it's been my life
for many years.
But it's not over.
[Haines] 57-lap race, yeah.
Easy to overtake. High tire degradation.
After ten years in the sport,
I don't want to have any regrets.
I believe, if I can do well,
I have a chance
to be in Formula 1 next year.
[engine revving]
[Haines] <i>Twenty seconds. Twenty seconds.</i>
[Albon] There's no secret
how much I want to stay here.
[Haines] <i>Ten seconds. Ten seconds.</i>

[machinery whirring]
[engine revving]
[indistinct chattering in background]
[Buxton] Okay. Three, two, uh, one.
Just this morning,
the Haas F1 team announced
that both of their drivers
would be leaving the team
at the end of the season.
-[Grosjean] I'm so pissed off.
-[Kevin] Yeah, it's fucked up.
[reporter 1] How did they take the news?
{\an8}[Steiner] Uh, uh, they, you know, they…
{\an8}I mean,
they were very professional about it.
{\an8}[reporter 2] Romain, talk to us
about the future, if you would.
{\an8}[Romain] It's bloody difficult
to find a seat for 2021
{\an8}when you are let go that late in 2020.
It's gonna be tough.
[Steiner] So, it seems
to be managed pretty good, you know?
Letting people go is never easy,
but, uh, all good things have, uh, an end.
[Romain] Uh, GPS.
[Keedle] Uh, getting it now.
It doesn't know where we are.
-Right.
-[pop music playing over radio]
12:19 arrival, allegedly, mate.
Let's see what you can do.
{\an8}I'm gonna say 12:24.
{\an8}I'm gonna say
F-U-C-K you.
[Keedle chuckles]
[radio host] <i>The race is on,</i>
<i>or rather, it's soon to be off</i>
<i>for Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.</i>
I<i>t's potentially the end of F1</i>
<i>for Grosjean.</i>
[Keedle] Bullshit!
-[guest] <i>It is. Um, unfulfilled poten--</i>
-[Romain scoffs] Yeah…
Bit of a strange feeling,
uh, just because I've been spending
five years with Haas.
<i>-</i>[commentator] <i>Grosjean comesfourth.</i>
-[Steiner] Amazing.
[Grosjean] I've put a lot of effort
and passion into the team.
I always pushed for us to do better.
[commentator] <i>Grosjean is having issues</i>
<i>with his car.</i>
Just call him in.
End this fucking pain, you know?
[Grosjean] Fucking hell.
There's a lot I can accept, but not this.
So, to be let go at the end of the year,
it hurt me a little bit.
[Keedle] Ah, this is beautiful.
[Grosjean] But right now, it's relax,
breathe and cool down and focus again.
[kite surfer] How does it feel?
-Not too bad.
-[Kite surfer] Yeah.
Here he goes.
[Grosjean] After ten years in the sport,
retirement, it's a conversation I had
with my wife, my family and my kids.
They know the risk of Formula 1,
but I told them
if there is an opportunity to carry on,
I'm gonna jump on it.
Stopping is not an option.
[kite surfer] Yeah!
[Gow] It's incredibly hard for drivers
who've spent their entire lives
trying to be in Formula 1,
{\an8}leaving that is almost like
stepping away from an addiction.
There we go.
[Buxton] Romain's a racer.
He doesn't want to leave Formula 1,
{\an8}but he's left without a race seat in 2021.
And right now, he's not the only one.
[electronic music playing]
[commentator 1]
<i>This is the Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>
<i>The first of its kind,</i>
<i>a double-header in Bahrain</i>
<i>as two races are held here back-to-back</i>
<i>over two weekends.</i>
[Grosjean] No news. I can't find a team.
[commentator 2] <i>It's a big couple of races</i>
<i>for many of the teams</i>
<i>and especially for numerous drivers</i>
<i>who come here uncertain of their futures.</i>
[Pérez] Now, at least, the news is out
and we can get on with it.
-Hi, guys.
-[reporter] Well, Checo.
Uh, big news, uh,
regarding you, obviously.
From what the team said,
was there anything to prepare you
for what we now know is going to happen?
{\an8}[Pérez] No. All the feedback I was getting
was that we all wanted to continue,
{\an8}so, uh, there was nothing
to prepare me, really.
At no point
I felt my seat was at a real risk
because the feedback
that I got from Otmar…
{\an8}[Otmar] I don't like
to talk about contractual stuff.
…was that they wanted to continue with me,
and then very late,
we found out that that wasn't the case.
I was extremely disappointed.
It could have been handled a bit better.
[Buxton] You got your guy.
Four-time world champion on the team.
You must be thrilled.
[Otmar] We really look forward
to working with Sebastian.
It was not an easy decision.
Checo's done a great job for us,
but when Seb became available,
we thought it was, uh, a good match.
How are you gonna approach things?
Obviously, the season
is coming to an end soon,
so very soon,
I will know what the future holds for me.
-Thanks.
-[reporter] Thanks very much. Good luck!
[camera shutters clicking]
[Buxton] Poor kid.
Feel sorry for him.
[Pérez] That was pretty hard
for me personally, to take that decision
because I felt the decision
had nothing to do with performance.
[manager] It's a crazy world.
You haven't got a team.
[Perez] You know
that there are not many vacancies.
[Buxton] Checo's had, uh,
an unbelievable year.
In what could be
his best ever season in Formula 1,
he's left potentially with nothing.
[indistinct chattering]
[whirring]
[Pérez in Spanish] I think this
is a situation that's out of my hands.
[physio] Let's see.
Let me put this over your head.
[Pérez] I want to carry on.
I don't know anything else.
I've never done anything else.
[physio] Yeah.
Last one.
Relax.
Hold it.
[physio strains]
Get up.
[Pérez in English] Weekend after weekend,
I think I… I've delivered.
I hope now, you know, the team can see
that I've maximized my opportunities
with the car that I've been given.
What comes next, I don't know.
Anything could happen.

[commentator 3] <i>That's a huge repair job</i>

<i>To get that ready for qualifying tomorrow,</i>
<i>that will be an all-nighter</i>.
[Horner] He just needs
to have a straightforward weekend.
I can't remember him
qualifying fourth, fifth,
getting a decent start,
just a smooth weekend.
The situation with Alex is very clear.
{\an8}I think every single member of this team
wants to see him succeed.
He's aware, you know, that…
he needs to step it up.
The problem is if he doesn't,
there are gonna be
some difficult decisions to be made.
[Albon] Should've pulled out of it.
I was a bit surprised by the lack of grip.
{\an8}I know there's always gonna be pressure
on the second seat at Red Bull.
All I know is
that I've got two races to show them…
[chuckles] …you know, that I can do this.
[Buxton] Checo.
Shaping up
to be another good weekend for you.
Great performance.
Your race pace got the big boys worried.
Mercedes, Red Bull,
they're all looking at you.
-They know you can be a contender.
-[Pérez] Uh…
[chuckles]
…I think they're a step too far.
[Horner] I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't explore all options.
Sergio has done such a great job this year
that you couldn't fail to recognize that.
[reporter] How would a dark blue
racing suit suit you with Red Bulls on it?
[Pérez] It's, uh…
Yeah, I think it would look nice.
I already have a bit of blue.

This… this was a big one.
This was a big one.
[helicopter blades whirring]
[flames whooshing]
[Leclerc] Is he okay?
[Padros] <i>I will come back to you.</i>
[Leclerc] No, please.
[Albon] Ah, fuck.
Has he got out?
[Rennie] <i>No information on it yet.</i>
[Kevin] Shit. Is he… Is he okay?
[Gannon] <i>Come into the pit lane.</i>
[Kvyat] Oh, tell me he's okay.
Please tell me he's okay.
There are certain moments
where silence falls on a racing track
and you know what that means.
[helicopter flying overhead]
[somber music playing]
[Steiner] You cannot do anything.
You're just a passenger to this.
The world seems to be coming down on you.
Once you see fire,
that's the worst thing you can have.
This is bad.
[flames whooshing]
[high-pitched ringing]
{\an8}[Lewis] Yeah, this one was hard to watch.
{\an8}I felt very, very vulnerable
in that moment.
[Steiner] Everything goes
through your head.
You don't think that anybody
can get out alive of this one.
[flames roaring]
[Steiner] I've been doing racing
long enough. There is no good outcome.
He's not coming out.
[Buxton] The longer you sit and you wait,
the more…
the fear kicks in
because your instincts are…
that you know what the reality is.
-[flames roaring]
-[water rushing]
[helicopter blades whirring]
{\an8}When I saw the fireball,
I couldn't believe this could happen
{\an8}in modern Formula 1 cars.
And a car shouldn't break in two.
Only when you see those things
do you believe the danger that we go into.
{\an8}The big question was
{\an8}where's… where's the rest of the car
and where is the driver?
I did think
that it would be a very bad outcome.
As I looked to my right,
I could see, uh, the driver
through the… the gap in the flame.
[ominous music playing]
[dramatic music playing]
[fireball exploding]
[ethereal music playing]
[Horner] Not only has he survived
going through a barrier,
at 160 miles an hour,
with… within a ball of fire...
The heat must have been so extreme.
It was a miracle.
It was absolutely a miracle.
[Ian] He wanted to walk to the ambulance,
and I was insisting, "No, no, no, no,
we'll get the ambulance here,"
but he wanted to demonstrate
that he was okay.
He got a message to everyone,
his wife and family in particular,
that he was out
and he was in a good place.
[Caco] How the fuck
did he come out of that?
H… ho… how did he jump out?
That's… that's an act of God.
[Steiner] He's on his way to hospital
to get checked out,
but, uh, he's completely conscious.
He had, what I was told,
minor burns on his hands on his feet.
He's… he… he's okay.
They did a fantastic job to get him away
as quick as possible from the fire.
It was amazing, uh, what they did
and thank you a lot to them.
[reporter] Thanks for your time, Guenther.
[Steiner] I need to find out
who was in that rescue car.
Fucking hell, they've done a great job.
The guy with the extinguisher.
-I just want to…
-[Sean] Absolutely.
-[Steiner] I need to find out who it was.
-Okay.
-[helicopter blades whirring]
-[tense music playing]
[Steiner] He got lucky today.
He got away with it.
Just have to say thank you
to somebody up in heaven.
[commentator 1]
<i>It does look as if this race will restart</i>,
<i>and for those drivers,</i>
<i>they now have to somehow</i>
<i>get back in their cars</i>
<i>and drive as if nothing has happened.</i>
[Pérez] On those occasions,
you have to be really strong.
You have to disconnect from that,
don't think about Romain anymore.
Focus on… on what you are about to do
and then back in the car
and go through it again.
[Lewis]
You have to compartmentalize it somehow.
You make a decision,
"I'm going to continue, yep,"
and you just keep going.
It's just the wild desire
to drive these cars on the limit
and nothing's gonna change that.
[Pérez] We are different.
We are Formula 1 drivers. We are…
We are crazy people.
[commentator 3] <i>Lights out and away we go.</i>

{\an8}[Albon] Yeah, I'm trying.

What's impressed me is

[Albon] I know there's still work to do.
Of course I wanna stay here,

was… was really special.

[commentator 1]
<i>Red Bull, uh, with both Max and Alex</i>

[fireworks exploding]
[somber music playing]
[Pérez in Spanish]
Yesterday was a sad day for everyone.
I've had a lot of bad luck.
The important thing yesterday
was that Grosjean walked away
from that accident with his life.
It's been an emotional roller coaster.
[in English] This is strong.
-[man] This is water.
-[Pérez] Mexican water!
[in Spanish] The podium was in the bag
and got away from us.
Yes.
[Pérez in English]
The podium would've meant a lot,
to remind everyone how good I am,
what I can do in the car.
And it's a big hit.
This game is called Black Widow.
[Pérez] Formula 1, it's been my life
for many, many years.
You don't have to have the best game.
Just make sure that you don't lose.
And now, it looks like I'm leaving
at the end of the year.
It makes me feel very, very sad.
As a Mexican,
it's very hard to get into Formula 1.
[commentator 1] …<i>still not enough.</i>
<i>You can see the shadow…</i>
<i>And then you can see Pérez.</i>
<i>That was tight!</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>Sergio Pérez here, great racing.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>He's gonna go on his way now.</i>
[Pérez] You have to leave your country
at a very young age.
You have to sacrifice your childhood,
basically.
[in Spanish] Of course,
I will fight for the championship.
[in English] At the age of 14,
I went to Germany.
I was on my own
while other kids were with their family.
[Tim] <i>Amazing, Checo, well done.</i>
[reporter] What an unbelievable first race
in Formula 1. Sum it up for us.
[cheering]
[Pérez] After ten years in the sport,
it's a bit emotional.
My target is to keep in Formula 1,
but, um, I don't know what will happen.
[tense music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>What a week it's been</i>
<i>in the world of Formula 1</i>
<i>and here we are.</i>
<i>Welcome back to Bahrain.</i>
[Buxton] Hello. Hell… I've got nothing.
-[man] Yep.
-[Buxton] There you go.
[commentator 1] <i>There is plenty</i>
<i>to talk about before the second race</i>
<i>in this double-header in the desert.</i>
<i>And obviously,</i>
<i>the latest is Romain Grosjean</i>
<i>who will not be taking part.</i>
[camera shutters clicking]
-[man 1] Romain.
-[man 2] Well done.
-[Grosjean] Thank you.
-[man 3] Good to see you.
[reporting in German]
[man exclaims excitedly]
[man chuckling]
-I'm so fucking happy to see you.
-[Grosjean] Thank you, my friend.
-Steiner.
-[Steiner] How are you?
[Grosjean] Yeah.
The knee is getting really good.
Ankle also.
And, uh, only question with this one.
They're talking about a graft.
Yeah.
So I say, "Everyone who's gonna
shake my hand's gonna shake my arse!"
[all chuckle]
[Steiner] But you can laugh at least!
I can still hear the…
[makes whooshing noise] …coming up, yeah.
You see it in movies
and think it's not true, it's true.
The hit with the wall wasn't hard.
Uh, it… it's strange because it was 56 Gs
you know, so it means
my body was about 3.9 tonnes.
Uh…
And then I remember opening my eyes
when everything stopped.
And I tried to lift myself
and jump out of the car
and I… I feel that I hit something
on top of my helmet
so I sit back down and I thought,
"Well, I'm upside down,
against the wall or whatever."
"Someone will come and rescue me.
I'll just wait."
[flames roaring]
Then I look a bit right and a bit left,
and then it's all orange on the left.
Uh, why is it orange? It's not sunset.
Is it the light from the circuit? No.
Oh, it's fire.
[flames whooshing]
I tried to go up, didn't work.
Right didn't work. Left didn't work.
Sit down, try to understand.
Go left, it was twitching a bit, the head.
Okay, it works, but my foot is stuck.
I sit back down and…
there's a time where…
I think, "That is it," you know?
[flames whooshing]
[Grosjean] I started asking myself
very simple questions.
"Where am I going to burn first?
Is it going to be painful?"
Few people have known that moment,
uh, where…
you almost accept that you're dead.
[Steiner] Fucking hell, yeah.
How are the kids?
[Marion] They ask many questions.
Then the kids… kids came in the car.
They said
"No, Daddy, this is not happening."
I said, "No, I cannot finish like this."
"It cannot be… It cannot be the end."
It was like "boom-boom-boom-boom,"
survival instinct.
I put my hands in the fire
and I can feel my hands are burning.
I can see the gloves that are red normally
become completely black
and… and I can feel the pain.
[flames roaring]
[Grosjean] But at that time,
I don't… I don't care, you know?
[fireball explodes]
And when the shoulders are going through,
the doctor pulls on my overall
and… and this is the time
I realized I was alive.
I was going to live.
And that feeling, I think,
will stay in my head forever.
[fireball explodes]
[Marion] I still can't believe it.
From the moment of the crash
till the moment
that we saw on the TV that he was alive.
Two minutes 45.
[Marion chuckles]
[Marion] I mean, I… Words still fail me.
And the longer it was lasting,
the more I started to believe
that he… he was dead.
And, um…
[exhales sharply, chuckles]
Even a few days after that,
our oldest son, Sacha,
he said, "Oh, I was scared
that he would be burned everywhere."
[somber music playing]
[applause]
[Grosjean] I'm still a racer
and I'll still miss racing
this weekend, but, uh…
the priorities that were here last week
are, you know, very different.
It changed my life forever.
-You are the man that crossed the road?
-Yes.
[cameras clicking]
[Grosjean] F1 is a job, it's a passion.
Put my parents, my wife, my kids,
my friends through that stress again
if I have a big crash?
I… I don't think I can.
For two minutes 43 seconds,
for them, I was dead.
[cheering, applause]
[Grosjean] So yes,
I'm sad about leaving Formula 1, but…
yeah, there is no…
you know, there's no regret.
I think now, it's just…
life will be much more beautiful.
I mean, when you go through that
and you have a second birthday,
a second chance in life,
a chance of life,
uh,
yeah, you… you just take it.
[Steiner] Thank you very much, Romain.
[whistling]
[Grosjean] I… I didn't win a race,
I didn't win the championship,
but I will have a legacy forever
in Formula 1.
You know, I…
I'm the man that walked out of fire.

-So lucky, man.
[Leclerc] I never thought
it was going to end up this way.
Congratulations. Amazing job.
-[Leclerc] I just wanted to apologize.
-Thanks for coming. Thank you.
When I leave, I think
I'll be very thankful to the sport,
to Formula 1,
because what they've given me,
they've changed my life forever.
[in Spanish] I needed this, man.
What's up, man? Good job.
-You're a badass, man.
-[Pérez] We're all badasses.
[in English] Thank you,
mate, for everything.
[sighs]
If this is to be the end,
I'm extremely pleased and… and happy
for what I have achieved.
So, thank you, Formula 1.
[fireworks sizzling]
[fireworks banging loudly]

[phone continues ringing]
<i>-</i>[Pérez] <i>Hello, Christian.</i>
-Hey, Sergio.
-Welcome to Red Bull.

-[triumphant music playing]
-<i>Thanks, man.</i>
Congratulations and welcome to the team.
<i>Thanks, Christian.</i>
<i>I'm so much looking forward to it.</i>
Sergio Pérez is confirmed

{\an8}[commentator] <i>As we bring to an end</i>
<i>the Formula 1 season,</i> <i>it is down to this.</i>
[Buxton] The battle for third
in the Constructors', it's incredible.
At the last race of the season,
we still have this massive fight.
-We're in a good position.
-It'll go down to the wire.
Who wants it more will probably do it.
-[Loos] <i>Let's fuck some shit up.</i>
-[Daniel] Everything we got.
[crowd cheering, whistling]
If you're gonna take on Mercedes,
you've gotta be firing on all cylinders.
-[Max] Come on, boys!
-[commentator] <i>The season finale!</i>
[upbeat electronic music playing][commentator 1]
<i>Welcome to the season finale.</i>
<i>It's the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</i>
[producer] I can't believe
you've recovered so quickly.
Yeah. Me too, man.
Only just made it.
[commentator 2] <i>Lewis Hamilton is back.</i>
<i>He's tested negative for COVID.</i>
It's been a year like, like no other.
[commentator 3]
<i>The World Championship record is equaled.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>is a seven-time champion of the world.</i>
I think what we've done as a team is…
It's very special.
[commentator 3] <i>It's seven consecutive</i>
<i>Constructors' Championships for Mercedes.</i>
If you're gonna take on Mercedes,
you've gotta be firing on all cylinders.
[commentator 2]
<i>Oh dear. That's Max Verstappen.</i>
-Fuck!
-[Max] Something broke.
[commentator 3] <i>Max Verstappen is out</i>
<i>of this race and out of the car as well.</i>
You need to see that gap reduced.
[commentator 2] <i>Can Red Bull put down</i>
<i>a marker for next year?</i>
<i>And who will prevail</i>
<i>in this epic battle for third?</i>
We're in a very good position.
It's gonna go down to the wire.
Who wants it more will probably do it.
[machinery whirring]
[engine revving]
[funky music playing]
{\an8}The battle for third in the Constructors',
it's absolutely incredible
{\an8}that we should be
at the last race of the season…
'Sup?
…and still have
this massively important fight.
[Zak] I think we've got a good plan.
It's all coming together.
And now it's going down to the wire.
[upbeat music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>We have come to the final</i>
<i>of the pre-practice sessions in 2020.</i>
[Lando] The battle
for third is Racing Point…
The key is
I don't want to overheat the tires.
[Lando] …Renault…
[Friend] It's gonna be hot again.
I think 30 degrees or something.
[Lando] …and us.
[Zak] All right,
let's fucking win this thing.
[chuckling]
{\an8}It's a game where you want
to make the most
{\an8}of other people's misfortunes,
{\an8}but, uh also realize that, at any point,
things could happen to you.
If anything, we thought Racing Point
would be quite convincingly third,
so we brought a very good fight to them.
And we knew it was gonna be
a very tough fight with Renault.
[Cyril] You think
we should be competitive there?
{\an8}I've never been so…
probably excited about finishing third
in a championship before.
It's been a hell of a battle.
[loud whirring]
I mean, at times,
Racing Point's been third,
McLaren's been third, we've been third.
[Lance] It's gonna be tight,
but all we can do is focus on this weekend
{\an8}and end the season on a strong note.
That's, uh, you know, the hopes.
[Daniel] To fuck shit up in
all the good ways possible.
That's what I'm hoping to do. [chuckles]
[suspenseful music playing]
[engine revving loudly]
[commentator 1]
<i>On board with Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
[Loos] <i>Nice job, mate.</i>
Two or three more laps like this
would be great.
[Daniel] Okay, this is about my pace now.
[commentator 2] <i>Very classy performance.</i>
<i>He's absolutely flying.</i>
Yeah, I think 'cause I'm, uh,
I just have amazing natural abilities,
uh, I'm the epitome
of human high performance…
[snickers]
[commentator 3] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>is having a very good final sector here.</i>
It's just hard.
It's just hard to be humble.
It's really hard!
[giggles]
I'm just kidding.
[commentator 1] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>absolutely aces the final sector</i>
<i>and goes second fastest.</i>
[machinery whirring]
[Daniel] I honestly feel
I'm getting better each year.
There's things I'm still…
internally, I know I'm doing better,
even if it's controlling the pressure,
controlling the emotion.
It's also experience, you know. It's…
it's my tenth year, I think, in Formula 1
and I'm at that,
probably at that nice balance now
where I've got, still got the desire
and the, let's say, the will
to push the car to the limit,
but I've also got now the knowledge
and experience
of being a tenth-year driver.
Is that a podium, boys?
Is that a fucking podium?
[Loos] <i>It's a fucking podium!</i>
<i>-He's here.</i> <i>Woo!</i>
-[Daniel laughs]
-[Loos] <i>Mega, man, mega.</i>
<i>-</i>[Daniel] Oh!
[commentator 3] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>comes home in third place</i>
<i>and gives Renault their first podium</i>
<i>since Malaysia in 2011.</i>
[Cyril] A fucking podium, Daniel!
Thank you!
[man] Well done.
{\an8}Every single lap
that we see Daniel performing,
a moment of uh,
of joy and satisfaction, of pleasure,
but at the same time,
it's negative emotion
because we also measure what
we'll be missing, what we'll be losing.
[crowd cheering, whistling]
[Daniel] It feels like
the first podium again.
The joy and, uh, the feeling was missed,
so yeah, I'm very happy.
[cheering]
For him, it was so important
to make the point and to show
that until the last lap of the last race,
he will be loyal to his decision
that he made a few years ago.
I'm sorry, but yeah,
it's… it's not complete.
It's not over yet.
[crowd cheering]
[Daniel] So, we made the bet.
It was if I get a podium,
uh, he has to get a tattoo.
[both chuckling]
I probably threw it out there because
I've got more than a tattoo or two.
I was like, "Why don't you get one?
Do you have any?"
He goes, "No."
I was like, "That's it. Tattoo."
So he was like, "Okay."
[chuckling] Well, you know what,
if we do a podium, I'll do a tattoo!
-[Daniel] You've got to.
-[Cyril chuckling] I can't… It's not…
[Daniel] We've achieved the achievable
and it's time to get it done.
[Daniel] Have you done this one before?
-The buffet?
-[Friend] No.
-For lunch?
-We had it for dinner, it was cool.
[Daniel] It's good
to get something healthy, eh?
Sometimes, I give up, I'm like…
[Italiano] It's the first time I didn't
check the dessert menu. [chuckles]
-[Friend chuckling] Says the Dyson!
-What's that book?
[Friend] One of the boys gave it to me
to give to you. Look.
There's some
of the most, like, horrific tattoos.
-Oh my gosh!
-[Friend] It's for Cyril!
[all chuckle]
[Daniel] Oh no!
I've never seen someone so excited
to get a tattoo, so… [chuckles]
That Homer Simpson one's awesome.
[snickering]
Have you seen the Judge Judy one?
[all laugh]
I spoke to him the other night about it.
He reckons he's gonna get it on his ankle.
-[Daniel] Yeah.
-That's the most painful spot!
-But I think he feels it's like… Yeah.
-It's hidden.
[Daniel] We can pass this on to Cyril.
-It's the worst tattoos.
-[snickering]
[Daniel laughs]
[Cyril] I was not betting
against my own luck,
I was not betting against my own team,
and I'm extremely happy
to have to honor this… this obligation
now that we've done this podium.
[dance music playing]
[Caco] Oh, yeah, a bit of sun!
♪ <i>There you are looking at me</i>
<i>On the elevator… ♪</i>
[server] Fruit platter?
For you?
Thank you.
[Caco] No, it's not for him. No, no, no.
It's for us.
-No, leave it here.
-[chuckling]
[Sainz] I am the athlete.
I need to hydrate.
[Caco] What do you mean
he's a very important person?
-He pays.
-He pays.
But leave it here.
[Caco] Yay!
So, battle for third,
{\an8}we are behind our friends there
in Racing Point.
{\an8}A few more than Renault
and a few more than Ferrari.
-[server] Thank you.
-Thank you.
We've gone all of a sudden
from being the underdog
to having a chance
to win that midfield battle.
We are doing a good job
of making it to the points with both cars.
I think it's time for…
-[sexy R&B music playing]
-There you go.
[Lando] With Carlos's podium last season,
a lot of people saw him as,
you know, <i>the </i>driver within the team.
That hit me hard because it's something
I'd want more than anything,
but then it switched, I think,
quite heavily, as we came into the season.
I started the year with a podium,
then a lot more people saw me
as being able to deliver when I need to.
How's it going, dude?
I'm quite sore after, um…
-[Zak] Golf?
-After golf.
-[Zak] Are you?
-Yeah.
-[Zak] What kind of golf were you playing?
-Men's golf.
[Zak chuckles]
[Lando] We're very tight
in the championship.
I think, you know, before the last race,
we were split by one point. I was behind.
Now, I'm one point ahead.
-What do you play off, 12?
-Uh, 16.
-Carlos is pretty good.
-Yeah.
[Lando] We want to beat each other,
but we also
need to do a good job for the team.
We don't have one driver doing really well
and one doing not well.
We're pushing each other,
and, uh, I think that's why
we're probably the closest pairing
or closest teammates on the grid
consistently in qualifying and races.
[Zak] Gonna be tight.
-Gonna be tight.
-[Zak] Yeah.
[Lando] Racing Point
have been third best the whole year.
We'll miss Carlos.
We've enjoyed our time racing with him,
{\an8}but, you know, we're… we're excited
{\an8}and, uh, in a couple of races' time,
{\an8}we'll be, uh, thinking
all about, uh, Daniel and… and Lando,
and hopefully,
that'll take us yet to another level.
[Lando] I wanna know what Daniel thinks
when he drives it.
What he brings, you know,
why everyone says he's so special,
why they say he's a better driver
than the majority of the grid.
Learning from him,
you know, a multiple race winner,
a guy who's worked
with multiple different teams and so on,
I just look forward
to that next chapter of the story.
[commentator 1]
<i>Welcome to the Yas Marina circuit.</i>
<i>It's time for one final blast</i>
<i>around the track</i>
<i>ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</i>
<i>It is the last qualifying of the season.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Renault have been quicker</i>
<i>than Racing Point and McLaren all week.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>It's a Grand Prix</i>
<i>for which pole position is crucial</i>
<i>and the last five races have all been won</i>
<i>by pole position here.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>A tenth and a half</i>
<i>covers the top four.</i>
<i>It's very much Red Bull versus Mercedes.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Something is changing</i>
<i>a bit for a Mercedes team this evening</i>
<i>that have been one and two</i>
<i>in qualifying here,</i>
<i>uh, for the last six Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>So, pressure then,</i>
<i>on Daniel Ricciardo of Renault,</i>
<i>just to get into Q3.</i>
<i>Also pressure on Lando Norris' McLaren.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>As we watch Lance Stroll.</i>
<i>Can he get into Q3?</i>
[commentator 2] <i>That'll do nicely.</i>
<i>Lewis, then, really treating his tires</i>
<i>extremely kindly on the out lap.</i>
<i>Hamilton crosses the line.</i>
<i>He's back on pole position.</i>
<i>Who can deny him now?</i>
[commentator 1] <i>What about Max Verstappen?</i>
<i>He's gone best of all</i>
<i>in the middle sector.</i>
<i>He was only a tenth down in the first.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen's taken pole</i>
<i>in the season finale.</i>
[raucous cheering]
[Lambiase] <i>Pole position.</i>
<i>That's a statement.</i>
<i>-Excellent job.</i>
-[Max] Yes!
Come on, boys! Come on!
[Horner] Well done, Max.
Mega lap. Well done!
[Max] Ah, this feels good. [chuckles]
Well done, boys. Amazing. Amazing.
[commentator 1] <i>Great lap by Norris,</i>
<i>powering his way.</i>
<i>Gets to about 200 miles an hour.</i>
[Joseph] P4. Get in.
[Lando] <i>Fuck yeah!</i>
[chuckles] Nice.
[commentator 2] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>can't get into the top ten</i>
<i>and he misses out by just four hundredths</i>
<i>of a second to his teammate.</i>
<i>That's a shocker.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>I fully expected him</i>
<i>to clear the bar and get into Q3.</i>
<i>Both Renaults are out.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Lance Stroll takes</i>
<i>eighth place on the grid, sadly for him.</i>
<i>That's going</i>
<i>to make Racing Point uncomfortable.</i>
[Lance] You know, I want to do well,
so I… I'm frustrated,
but overcoming tough times
and getting through them,
that's something that, um,
I've improved at as I've matured.
[peaceful music playing]
[seagulls calling]
[Lance] Fucking surfing!
Nice one.
[chuckles]
I look back and there's been
quite a few, uh, highlights this season.
It's great when you do well.
I was on pole a few weeks ago.
[commentator 1] <i>Here comes Lance Stroll.</i>
<i>Stroll crosses the line</i>
<i>and he does go pole!</i>
<i>-1:47.7.</i>
-[cheering]
[Lance] It was just
such an amazing achievement.
Yes, boys!
[chuckles gleefully, whoops]
Let's go!
You dream about things in the sport
and one of those things
is to stand on the podium,
to win a race,
and, you know, to be on pole.
Brad, I wanna hear you say it, mate.
That's pole position!
I wanna hear you say it!
[chuckles gleefully]
[Joyce] <i>That's pole position, Lance,</i>
<i>pole position.</i>
[Lance] Let's go!
I love my job.
{\an8}[Otmar] Lance did a great job
putting it on… on pole,
{\an8}which just shows what talent, uh, he has.
And then after that, in Bahrain,
we scored a significant amount of points.
[commentator 1] <i>Sergio Perez comes home</i>
<i>to win the Sakhir Grand Prix!</i>
-[crowd cheering, squealing]
-[cars zooming]
[commentator 1] <i>And it's the first ever</i>
<i>double podium for Racing Point as well,</i>
<i>as Lance Stroll takes third place.</i>
[Joyce] <i>Well done, Lance.</i>
<i>P1 and P3 for the team.</i>
[Lance] Well done, guys.
But… [sighs]
…you know, sometimes, um…
you love the sport
and it just don't love you back.
[commentator 2] <i>Here comes Dani Kvyat</i>
<i>down the inside</i>.<i> Oh, there's contact!</i>
<i>Massive accident.</i>
-[groaning]
-[Joyce] <i>Are you okay?</i>
[Lance] Yeah, I'm okay.
Definitely wasn't a normal race
after that happened.
[commentator 3] <i>There's Sergio Perez.</i>
<i>Oh, puffs of smoke!</i>
<i>That's Sergio Perez</i>
<i>very much out of this race.</i>
[Lance] You know, it's racing.
Some weekends are good
and some weekends are bad.
For sure, it sucks.
Uh, none of us were happy
walking away from that race,
but I'm still learning.
I think we learn every day.
You catch that six-meter wave?
-[Lance] You were killing it out there.
-Yeah.
[Lance] I definitely wanna work
on my consistency, get better
and, you know, be there more often.
Um, I just turned 22, so,
um, I do see myself getting better,
hopefully. [chuckles]
[helicopter blades whirring]
[commentator 1] <i>As we bring to an end</i>
<i>the Formula 1 season in 2020,</i>
<i>17 races and 3,249 racing miles,</i>
<i>it is down to this</i>
<i>to decide who gets that third spot</i>
<i>in the Constructors' Championship.</i>
[tense music playing]
[Buxton] There are
a fair few million reasons
why you'd wanna fight for third
in the Constructors' Championship.
It's not just about pride.
It's big bucks. Big, big bucks.
Racing Point are ten points ahead
of McLaren with one race to go.
That's an easy swing.
I would have said a few races ago,
it was Renault.
However, McLaren are the ones
that are right behind us.
[Buxton] Arguably, Racing Point have been
the third-fastest car of the season.
Anything less than third
in the Constructors'
could be seen
as a failure.
[Zak] We're on this journey
to get back to the front of the field,
and we've been ninth, sixth, fourth,
and here we are, fighting so hard
to finish third in the championship.
[commentator 2] <i>Renault's</i>
<i>a bit further back in the race for third,</i>
<i>12 points behind McLaren,</i>
<i>who are in turn</i>
<i>ten points behind Racing Point.</i>
Given all the water
that's gone under the bridge this year
between Racing Point and Renault,
there's no way Cyril wants to lose third
in the Constructors' Championship
to that team.
[Cyril] Racing Point this season,
uh, clearly, uh.
no one was expecting a team of this size
to… to be operating at that level.
So, clearly, finishing, uh, on that podium
of P3 for the Constructors'
would be, uh, quite something for us.
[airplane whirring]
[commentator 1] <i>It's a race</i>
<i>that could just conjure up anything</i>
<i>and you can feel it,</i>
<i>the pressure in the air.</i>
[tense suspenseful music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>With a ten-point lead</i>
<i>over underdogs McLaren</i>,
<i>Racing Point must be favorites.</i>
<i>And in his last race for the team,</i>
<i>only a fool would bet</i>
<i>against Daniel Ricciardo and Renault.</i>
-[Otmar] This is what it's all about, Tom.
-[Tom] Yeah.
Normal start.
[Zak] Let's have a good race.
I think we can pull it off.
I think we can pull it off.
[Loos] All right. Whatever happens today,
thank you for everything.
Fuck some shit up.
Give everything.
[Daniel] Yep. Thank you, boys.
Fifty-five laps.
Everything we got.
[commentator 2] <i>And for the final time,</i>
<i>we're racing in 2020.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Verstappen ahead of Bottas.</i>
<i>Norris getting a good start,</i>
<i>but behind Lewis Hamilton.</i>
<i>Into the first real big braking zone</i>
<i>we go.</i>
<i>Daniel Ricciardo on the Ferrari</i>
<i>at the hairpin</i>
<i>and he's got himself</i>
<i>ahead of Sebastian Vettel.</i>
[Loos] <i>Currently,</i>
<i>your pace is faster than anyone up to P4.</i>
[Daniel] Understood.
[gleeful exclamations]
[commentator 2] <i>Here comes Lance Stroll.</i>
<i>Two points in it at the moment</i>
<i>between McLaren and Racing Point,</i>
<i>now that Lance Stroll has moved up</i>
<i>into seventh place.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Sergio Perez still right at the back.</i>
[engine struggling]
[Perez] I'm losing power.
[groaning]
[Perez] I lost the fucking engine again.
I'm off.
[commentator 3]
<i>That is absolute heartbreak</i>
<i>for Perez and the Racing Point team.</i>
[man] You're fucking kidding me!
[commentator 3] <i>What could that do</i>
<i>for the team's ambitions</i>
<i>to finish third</i>
<i>in the Constructors' Championship?</i>
-[Sainz] <i>What happened?</i>
-[Tom] Perez engine failure.
[Sainz] That's what I want to hear!
[Zak] Go on, Carlos!
[commentator 2] <i>Daniel Ricciardo in fifth,</i>
<i>stayed out and got track position.</i>
<i>-</i>[Loos] <i>Car behind is Norris.</i>
-[Daniel] Okay.
[Tom] We should naturally be quicker

[Lando] Yeah, confirm.
[Tom] This is looking really good.
[commentator 1]
<i>A good bet for fifth place, McLaren.</i>
<i>202 points as it stands at the moment</i>
<i>will be taking that third spot</i>
<i>in the Constructors' Championship.</i>
Nice job.
[commentator 3] <i>Stroll, the one remaining</i>
<i>Racing Point car left in this race.</i>
[Lance] Ah! Brakes are shit!
[commentator 2 grunts]
<i>Big lock-up there from Stroll.</i>
[Otmar] We've got a tire problem.
[Lance] We have no traction.
I'm trying to brake, but I lock up.
[commentator 1] <i>You can understand</i>
<i>Racing Point's concern there.</i>
<i>Pierre Gasly</i>
<i>has gone down the inside of Lance Stroll.</i>
<i>He's gone past the Racing Point.</i>
<i>They did touch as Gasly went through.</i>
[Lance] It's unbelievable how bad we are
at maintaining temperature.
[commentator 2]
<i>Stroll's gonna have to look out behind him</i>
<i>because Esteban Ocon's catching</i>
<i>at a rate of knots.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Verstappen, starting from pole,</i>
<i>he's led every single lap of the race.</i>
<i>As he rounds the final corner,</i>
<i>the checkered flag's in sight.</i>
<i>Verstappen wins the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</i>

<i>in perfect fashion</i>
<i>for himself and for Red Bull.</i>
[cheering]
[commentator 2]
<i>Norris crosses the line to finish in fifth</i>
<i>and his teammate Carlos Sainz,</i>
<i>home in sixth position.</i>
[Zak] Yeah!
[whooping]
Yeah!
[commentator 2]
<i>Daniel Ricciardo will be seventh.</i>
[Loos] Awesome job.
[Daniel] Thank you.
[commentator 2] <i>Ocon is really hustling</i>
<i>the Racing Point now</i>
<i>in the battle for ninth place.</i>
[Joyce] <i>Ocon has DRS.</i>
[Lance] Brad, leave me alone.
[Cyril in French] Go!
[Ocon in English] Yeah!
[commentator 2] <i>Esteban Ocon left</i>
<i>his good work right until the last minute.</i>
<i>It's gonna be Esteban Ocon</i>
<i>to finish in ninth place.</i>
-[Cyril] Yes!
-[fireworks exploding]

[chuckling]
[Slade] Oh, well done, mate. Good effort.
[commentator 1]
<i>Stroll couldn't score the points</i>

[Daniel] Oh, fuck. [chuckles]
Thanks, guys.
That was a nice way to send it off.
[Cyril] Thank you, Daniel.
And, uh, we look forward
to racing against you next year very much.
[Daniel in French] Thank you.
[in English] We can have a beer tonight.
[Cyril] <i>Two.</i>
[Lando] Congrats, everyone.
[Zak] Lando, great job.
Great job, Lando! [yelps]
-[Lando] Cheers, Zak.
-[Zak] <i>Yo, dude!</i>
[Lando] We all know you would've won
the race, but, you know, we did our best.
[Zak chuckles] Great job!
Woo!
Well, luck is,
uh, definitely a part of sport.
I think you create your own, uh, luck
by working very hard
and having great people.
I think this year, there's more
hard work and grit and determination
that's gone into it,
which is another step,
a lot more money for the team.
Getting that third spot's part
of that story I'm trying to make
with McLaren.
Getting back to that, winning races
and winning championships again.
We only did it in the last race,
so it was close,
but, um, as long as we improve some races,
my engineer does a better job, um…
[jeering]
…then I look forward
to another season next year
where we can hopefully do a bit better.
-[laughter]
-[man] Come on, man.
[whooping, applause]
[cheering]
{\an8}-[presenter] Congratulations.
-[whooping]
[Daniel] Leaving a team, moving on,
I think kind of breaking any relationship
is… is never easy.
I look back now,
and I look back at the start of 2019
and where we are now
and yeah, we really did build something.
I'm stoked that we can part ways
knowing that it was…
it was a really nice two years.
[team applauding]
[Cyril] Daniel is a fantastic driver.
I cannot not love Daniel.
I love Daniel. We all do.
Everyone's life has sort of…
uh, these moments where you know
you should be doing something
and waiting and pushing,
but procrastinating a bit.
Daniel is the one that has pushed us
into doing the changes.
I'm not convinced we would have done
those changes without Daniel.
Credit to Cyril, he actually called me
'cause he obviously,
he really wants to honor the bet.
And I said, "With lockdown, the way
Europe is at the moment, it's difficult,
so it'll probably have to wait
'til next year."
Who's paying? You paying or I'm paying?
[laughter]
He gets to choose a design
and I think he's done that,
and I get to choose the size and location
and I've done that also.
Not too visible.
But a Mike Tyson thing, no.
[Daniel] I guess the base of it
will be something quite traditional
and then maybe
with, like, a little bit of, uh,
a honey badger involvement in there.
But I don't wanna make it too,
like, cheesy or anything,
but it should also be something
that maybe he looks at and giggles,
uh, for… for the rest of his days.
[chuckles]
[cheering]
We should have come third,
but it's not easy to do.
Next year,
our driver line-up is, uh, Lance
and Sebastian,
four-time world champion, a veteran.
{\an8}[Lawrence] We wanted to bring in a driver
who had the experience
{\an8}of working with world-championship teams.
[Otmar] To have a young,
up-and-coming driver
with an experienced driver
is the right thing to do,
and who better to learn from
than Sebastian Vettel,
who's a four-time world champion?
Lance can learn from Seb
and, uh, and hone it
such that he too, in the future,
can aspire to become a world champion,
so I think we got a great combination.
Next year,
Lawrence has big ambitions for the team.
[man] Any moment, guys, be ready.
Aston Martin is coming in,
a great name for Formula 1.
Ultimately,
it's all about contract performance
and there's a lot that goes into that.
And that's what Lawrence wants to do,
that's what we're gonna focus on
in the next two, three, four, five years.
Good morning.
The heart and soul of this company
started with its racing.
This is the factory
where the cars are built.
And then, to support its racing,
built the most luxurious
bespoke automobiles.
-[Lawrence] Looks really good.
-[man] Yep.
[Lawrence] So, it was natural
to be able to take Aston Martin
and align it
with these great bunch of guys
that is currently today Racing Point.
It's, I believe, the most exciting thing
to happen in Formula 1 in decades.
-That's a great color.
-[man] Yep.
[Buxton] Aston Martin are seen
as the British Ferrari.
That link with James Bond,
that 1960s chic.
It's very, very cool.
You get so excited,
seeing all this luxury product,
bring Formula 1 to market it
and put it on track next year,
it's very beautiful.
{\an8}This is where we have our design center.
Marek Reichman,
our chief creative director,
and his people…
Hello, Marek.
…are about to show me the visuals
of what our cars will look like
for next year on the grid.
-[Marek] How's it going?
-Good. You?
[Marek] Yeah, good.
What we have developed
is a very modern green color,
which has a dichromatic effect over it.
What does that mean?
It means
it really sparkles in the sunlight.
[Lawrence] That's spectacular.
This looks like it's going faster
standing still.
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.
We gotta make sure it's fast on the track.
That's great.
So, if there's been a lot of jealousy
on track of our performance this year,
there's gonna be a lot more jealousy
from our competitors
when they see
how good and quick we are next year.
[electronic music playing]
It's a difficult year.
{\an8}When the pandemic started, we didn't know
if we were gonna be still here or not
{\an8}and we needed to do tough decisions
about the drivers.
Thank you to all of you and thank you
for the time we had here with Kevin.
There is obviously ups and downs,
but that's life.
-All right, Kevin. This is for you.
-Thank you.
[whistling]
Next year, we'll have Mick Schumacher.
This year,
he was first in the F2 Championship.
[reporter] Mick Schumacher, Michael's son.
-This is the race helmet from 2012.
-Thank you. It's such an honor.
I really appreciate that. Thank you.
-And Nikita Mazepin.
-Yeah!
[Steiner] His father has come
to invest in the team.
It's a family which loves racing.
That is what, uh, Nikita loves
and what his dad loves.
For the future Haas F1 team,
I need sponsors, uh, uh, to survive.
I'm very happy to have him on board.
[Binotto] I'm really excited to start
as soon as possible in 2021.
{\an8}Now we've got a lineup of young drivers,
which is great.
Carlos did very well through the 2020,
and he's bringing
some know-how and experience.
He will fit very well with Charles.
Both young,
but already experienced drivers,
so I think
it's solid foundations for the future.
[cheering]
[Horner] The plan for 2021
is try and take off where we left off.
{\an8}We've beaten Mercedes at, arguably,
one of their most dominant venues.
It wasn't a lucky win.
It was a pole position
and a straight fight
against the two Mercedes.
Mercedes produced the most competitive car
they've ever done this year.
They are the benchmark currently
in Formula 1.
They have dominated the sport
for the last six years.
To beat them,
you've got to be at the top of your game.
We got ahead of them
by the end of the year.
It took a monumental effort,
but we've demonstrated it's possible.
[crowd cheering]
[Horner] With Sergio and his experience
alongside Max next year,
it's achievable.
We've just got to do it over 23 races
rather than over one race.
-[classical music playing]
-[crowd cheering]
{\an8}We've been unbeatable again in 2020
as a team
{\an8}and, um, it doesn't happen for no reason.
[commentator]
<i>Time after time after time,</i>
<i>Mercedes create</i>
<i>an absolute monster of a machine.</i>
{\an8}I think, when you reflect
on the seventh consecutive title,
you have that moment of satisfaction,
but that passes quickly.
You think about the next race
and you think about the next year,
what you need to do
in order to stay competitive.
There is no sense of entitlement
or complacency within the team.
[cheering]
{\an8}[notification chimes]
{\an8}[reporter] <i>Breaking news:</i>
{\an8}<i>Toto Wolff has signed up</i>
<i>for Mercedes for another three years.</i>
[Toto] I've led this team now
for seven years,
which means traveling to all Grand Prix.
I've spent 250 hotel nights last year.
More than 700 hours in an airplane.
And you start to ask yourself
how much longer can you do that?
But on the other side,
I'm a co-owner with Mercedes of the team.
I'm not gonna walk away.
Especially if you like to keep an overview
of what's happening.
So, in a way, you need to decide
whether you want to be on the dance floor
or on the balcony
and I'm on the dance floor at the moment.
But one day, I'd like to be on the balcony
and oversee the whole situation.
[engine rumbling]
[engine revving]
[tires squealing]
[Toto] I don't think we're done yet
with seven titles.
There's more to come.
[tires squealing]
[distant applause, cheering]
[Lewis] This year has been
about more than just racing.
[Chauvin] Relax.
[Floyd] I can't breathe, my face.
-[grunts]
-[Chauvin] What are you on?
I can't breathe!
{\an8}[Lewis] What happened with George,
it brought up a lot of emotion.
All of a sudden, things that have been
suppressed over my lifetime
bubbled to the surface.
And I was like…
I can no longer stay quiet.
{\an8}Every Black kid in the world will,
at some stage, experience racism.
{\an8}It's just a fact.
When people call you names
and the N-word's thrown around,
you're told to go back to your own country
when you're in your own country.
There are literally millions
and millions of people
who will have experienced
much, much worse,
and that needs to change.
[somber music playing]
[Lewis] I had it so many times.
[young Lewis] In the past years,
I've had racist names being called to me,
but lately, um,
if anybody has said anything to me,
I just ignore them.
[Lewis] I was just eight years old.
For someone to look down
at a young eight-year-old
and tell them they're not gonna
achieve anything in life,
they must be in a really bad place.
[reporter] As Lewis began to win,
the fact that he was
the only Black face on the track
became an issue.
[Lewis] My dad would always tell me,
"Tread carefully.
Be careful what you say."
We don't get involved with, um, people
who have problems about whether we win
or whether… what color we are.
We go out on the track and we do our best.
[producer] What's it been like for you
to be the only Black Formula 1 driver?
[Lewis] Sometimes I wonder why.
Why me? Why am I the…
the only Black driver that's come along
and had the ability,
not only to get in the sport,
but be at the front of it for so long?
That's okay.
I mean, I've been built for this.
People probably don't… [sighs]
…won't know
that I grew up, like, on my dad's couch,
so we didn't have any money.
I remember the struggle.
I remember how hard it was for my mum
with the multiple jobs she had
to keep a roof over mine
and my two sisters', uh, heads.
I remember how it was for my dad
to keep me racing.
[engine revving]
So, I… I know
how hard it was.
And then, on top of that,
that other struggle
with acceptance and not fitting in,
that's all bubbled up into,
hmm, you know…
created the beast, I guess,
that you see on the track.
[commentators overlapping]

The way I'm wired,
I… I don't really have a filter.
{\an8}I say what's on my mind
{\an8}and I'm not always too bothered
about upsetting someone
if it's gonna make a difference.
{\an8}[announcer]
<i>And the winner, Lewis Hamilton!</i>
[Lewis] What I think this year's shown was

{\an8}[producer] Season four.
{\an8}[chuckling] Yeah.
Can you believe it? I mean, wow.
-[woman] Look pretty now. No chatting.
-I've got to look pretty?
[producer] De-fluff.
{\an8}De-fluff?!
{\an8}-Is there fluff?
-[chuckling]
[Gasly] So I can't speak
about my dirty story anymore?
-[woman] No. [laughs]
-Don't want that on camera.
[producer] Welcome back.
{\an8}What are we gonna talk about this year?
{\an8}The feeling, coming into 2021,
{\an8}is one of a lot of excitement.
New teams in the form of Aston Martin
and Alpine.
Three rookies
entering Formula 1 this year.
My name is Yuki Tsunoda.
Mick Schumacher.
Nikita Mazepin, Haas F1 team.
-[producer] Can you do Russian as well?
-Yeah.
Nikita Mazepin, Haas F1 team.
-[man] How are you?
-[Lewis] Very good, thank you. Yourself?
{\an8}There is so much that's changed
up and down the pit lane.
Daniel Ricciardo is at McLaren.
Sebastian Vettel,
he's now at Aston Martin.
Carlos Sainz at Ferrari.
Fernando Alonso is back.
I haven't even mentioned Sergio Pérez.
[producer] No more pink.
[chuckling]
{\an8}If you can imagine,
I've been in this sport for ten years
{\an8}and I've never had an opportunity
with a top team.
-Hey.
-I'm happy for you.
[Pérez] Thank you.
-You've got a good opportunity.
-[Pérez] It's a great opportunity.
[Steiner] You have to take it.
And you will, I know you.
[Toto] What is that for an outfit?
[Ricciardo] It looks good.
To be in new colors, it feels great.
{\an8}I've been on the move, obviously,
the last couple of years,
{\an8}so this one,
I certainly feel like it's gonna stick
{\an8}and, um, we'll see this one through
with flying colors.
[director] First car is arriving, Ferrari.
So let's just show 'em where that is.
{\an8}The energy's a little bit different
this year.
{\an8}Obviously I have
a new teammate, Carlos Sainz.
We are getting on
very, very well together.
What do you think?
Our car changed quite a bit, huh?
{\an8}[chuckling] Red is not a color
that suits many people, you know? It's a…
It's a tricky color to… to wear.
But at the same time,
it's a dream come true.
[Leclerc] Ay-ah!
My feet!
-[Sainz] Sorry.
-[laughs]
-[Sainz] Did I kill you?
-Yeah.
-But it's the break, so it's fine.
-[both laugh]
[director] We got Mercedes coming.
Watch your backs, guys.
[Buxton] Mercedes will always
go into a season as the favorite,
but having won the title
for seven years in a row,
there has to come a point
at which that ends.
[director] Hey, what's up, Max?
How are you?
I c… I shouldn't say that
with a smile on my face.
[director] All right, everybody go stand
in the front of your wing, please.
[Lewis] Every season's different.
Do I still have it?
{\an8}Am I still fit enough? Am I still driven?
Can I still keep up
with all the new kids that are coming?
[director] Eye contact with the cameras.
George Russell is dicking around.
All right, guys.
In three, two, one, action. Action!
There's a lot of male pride
and ego flying around…
[director] Look directly in the camera.
…because there's so much at stake.
[director] Everybody keep looking
at camera, please.
[Buxton] You have warring teams racing,
not just for glory on the track,
but for hundreds of millions of dollars.
[director] George Russell!
George Russell, focus on the camera.
Thank you.
-You guys are good. Everyone's all good.
-[crew member claps]
[Buxton] But it's not just
about what's going on on the track.
It's everything that happens
off the track.
[producer 1] Yes, Toto!
Yes!
[Buxton] Formula 1's always
been described as the piranha club.
-[producer 1] Yes, here we go! Boom!
-[laughter]
Come on!
[Buxton] Team principals
are a fascinating breed.
The smiling face,
but the cloak and dagger.
Yeah, being able to play the politics
is about as important
as it is building a decent car.
[producer 1] Okay, so roll camera.
Action.
That's super. Don't mess with Guenther!
[Steiner] Last year was difficult.
Now we have got two new rookie drivers.
For us, it was better to invest
in young talent and bring them up,
so when we are ready, they are.
[producer 1] Got some great drivers,
car's working, got a super team.
-It's too good! Don't make it too good!
-[producer 1] This is great.
-[chuckles]
-[laughter]
-[producer 1] Otmar.
-[Otmar] Yes.
[producer 1] So new team!
{\an8}Aston Martin back on the grid
is a big story.
[producer 1] Could I get you to do,
like, a 007 thing?
No, not your thing?
-I'm too fat for that.
-[producer 1 laughs]
You're doing great, Mattia.
Big smile for us.
And maybe a "Yes!"
With a fist? [laughs]
[man] He's not that guy.
[Mattia in Italian] I believe Ferrari
is the heart and soul of this sport.
{\an8}We have to surpass ourselves
from a year ago.
[in English] Reminds me of the last time
I was convicted!
This year I'm expecting Ferrari
is gonna be very strong.
{\an8}Uh… So our… out goal, of course,
needs to be to retain third.
[producer 1] Action. Big boss.
[Brown] 'Cause you've got to assume
it's Mercedes at the front of the field.
I think it's gonna be tough
to beat 'em this year.
[shutter clicking]
[photographer] Nice and relaxed.
You seeing all these creases in the shirt?
[producer 2] No,
it's not the creases. It's just…
Dandruff?
[producer 2 chuckles]
[photographer] Okay, we're gonna try
some sitting, I think.
Think that's gonna be better?
{\an8}It has been a tremendous run
the last seven seasons
{\an8}with double World Championship titles.
[shutter clicking]
[photographer] Doing movement in there.
Like it. [laughs]
Fresh!
We've pushed the needle so far
that in a way, you're running around
with a target on your back.
Think there's a lot you need to photoshop.
Ten years of Formula 1
have shown the toll.
[crew members laugh]
-Okay, thank you very much.
-Thank you.
-Bye.
-Have a good evening.
[woman] Thank you, Adrian. See you.
[Gow] Let's face it, Mercedes have
ruthlessly dominated Formula 1 for years.
We want a real battle
for this championship.
It's not just the fans,
but also the management of Formula 1.
-[man 1] Good?
-[man 2] Yes. All good?
[Buxton] Stefano Domenicali,
former head of Ferrari.
is coming in to run Formula 1.
{\an8}I have the duty
to maximize the value of Formula 1,
{\an8}and on that, there's no discussion.
The title fight is…
it's very important
for the credibility of Formula 1.
That is the center of our sport.
How quickly you can go
from the stars to the gutters,
that's part of the game.
[Buxton] If you ask what
this season's title fight might look like,
I think most people would reluctantly say
business as usual.
Mercedes, seven World Championships
in a row.
No conceivable way anyone can beat them.
But at pre-season testing,
we saw something
that we've not seen in a very long time
and it could upset the competition
at the very top of the sport.
[commentator 2] <i>Show us</i>
<i>what you've got then, Mercedes.</i>
[engine revving, tires squealing]
{\an8}[Bottas] Something strange is happening.
{\an8}When I go to fifth gear,
the revs are doing something funny.
It's undriveable.
[Toto sighs]
{\an8}[Lewis] Yeah.
There's still a lot of understeer.
[faltering revving]
-[Lewis] I'm stuck in the gravel here.
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Switch it off. We'll come get you.</i>
[Buxton] It's too early to tell
whether Mercedes
truly have dropped the ball,
but the drivers don't look confident.
The car doesn't look
like a championship-winning car.
[Horner] If you look at Bottas,
he said, "I can't drive this car."
[Max] Yeah.
[Horner] He was moaning and bitching
like you wouldn't believe.
[Max] They're just all over the place.
[Mattia in Italian]
Mercedes has been dominating F1 for years,
but they've been on top for so long.
I think it's time for us,
or perhaps someone else,
to put them in their place.
[Steiner in English] It's about time
Toto gets a bit nervous,
that he's not sleeping at night, you know?
He had seven years of fantastic sleep,
you know, by dominating the championship.
I wouldn't mind
if he gets a bit under pressure.
[Lewis] In that moment we knew
there's so much work that we have to do.
Figure out how we can win this year.
The team are working harder now
than any other year.
[Toto] There have been many tough battles
in the eight years
since I joined the team,
but this year
feels a little bit different.
[Shovlin] <i>If we're being frank</i>
<i>with ourselves,</i>
<i>maybe we're not matching the standards</i>
<i>that we used to set,</i>
<i>but there's also no doubt</i>
<i>that the other teams</i>
<i>are tired of being beaten</i>
<i>and that they've started to raise the bar.</i>
[Toto] What I would like to say
is we mustn't feel the pressure
because we've done it
seven years in a row.
Each of us must get on top of the issues
in its own area of competence.
Let's just… Let's rock and roll.
Some of the directions we have taken
in terms of developing the car were wrong,
but we can't turn the time back.
[tense music playing]
[Horner] What you have to remember
about Toto
is that he inherited something
that was already well oiled.
He's not really had to build anything.
[in German] I'm already on the plane
and I'm on the way.
[Horner in English] He operates the team
in a very different way to me.
You know, he's much more motivated
by the financials of Formula 1
than perhaps the competition.
[producer] Christian likes to say
you're just kind of like a finance guy.
What d'you say to that?
[Toto] I don't care what others are doing.
It's about optimizing
my contribution in the team
without looking elsewhere.
[in German] No more mistakes.
[birdsong]
[horse nickering]
Horses do wanna be told what to do.
They want you to be in charge.
-They can feel it. If they're--
-They can feel it.
[Horner] A bit like racing drivers.
-If you're nervous, they're nervous.
-Yeah.
If you're in control, they're in control.
[Geri] I think Archie
is kind of a Bottas character,
if I would say.
-[Horner] Darling, I'm not riding Bottas!
-[Geri laughs]
[horse nickers]
[Horner] Being a team principal
of a Formula 1 team,
it's a constant pressure,
but I'm very fortunate.
You know, my wife, she's been
in a competitive environment herself.
She understands the stresses
of having to deliver, having to perform,
and so she's been incredibly supportive.
[Geri] So I was thinking about this
the other day, okay?
-Brand-new season.
-[Horner] Mm-hmm.
[Geri] Think this is gonna be the one?
[Horner] I dunno.
The Mercedes juggernaut
has been misfiring a bit.
I think there's a lot
of buzz around Red Bull.
I mean,
hopefully we can hit the ground running
in Bahrain at the first race
and build some momentum.
We've done a lot of winning,
we've done a lot of losing.
[Geri] A lot of losing.
-[Horner] It's time to get winning again.
-Yeah.
Saturday afternoon,
you're gonna see exactly where you are.
[reporter] The first qualifying of 2021!
Formula 1 is back.
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>The sun might well</i>
<i>be setting here in Bahrain.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>It's time</i>
<i>for the serious business.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>It's every man for themselves</i>
<i>to set the fastest lap time</i>
<i>you possibly can.</i>
[Buxton] Qualifying is everything
in Formula 1
because it determines your starting
position on the grid on Sunday.
{\an8}You wanna start from the front
{\an8}because it means you've got
the other 19 drivers starting behind you.
[Gow] It's a speed test
that really is psychological
as well as material.
Not just in trying
to help you win the race,
but proving you are the best driver
in the best car this season.
-[Stallard] Let's get stuck in.
-[Ricciardo] Yep. No worries.
Qualifying is so important.
It's like the bullshit stops.
The focus shifts.
Now it's go time.
[engine revving]
[commentator 1] <i>Ricciardo round</i>
<i>the final corner now</i>
<i>to set the time they all need to chase.</i>
[Ricciardo] By the end of this season,
I wanna look back
and say, "All right.
I made a difference to this team."
[commentator 1]
<i>And it is a time of 1:31:03.</i>
[Stallard] <i>Okay, buddy, good start.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>And now it's all eyes</i>
<i>on this man, Carlos Sainz.</i>
Ferrari is not in Formula 1
to finish third in the championship.
It's here to win.
[Adami] <i>Mode push.</i>
[Sainz] The target is
to hit the ground running
and try and adapt as quickly as I can
to this new team, to the car.
[commentator 4] <i>Carlos Sainz goes</i>
<i>into fourth place in the Ferrari.</i>
[Adami] <i>Well done, mate.</i>
{\an8}[Hamelin] <i>Go faster, Pierre.</i>
[Gasly] With Yuki coming
as, uh, the rookie,
I'm the most experienced driver
in… in the team.
-[Hamelin] <i>You need to push more, Pierre.</i>
-[Gasly] Yeah.
We all have our good days,
we all have our bad days.
We all struggle sometimes.
But I'm not worried.
[Hamelin] <i>P5.</i>
P5, man.
[commentator 4] <i>That was phenomenal</i>
<i>from Pierre Gasly.</i>
<i>We knew it would come down to this.</i>
<i>There are two teams who could take pole.</i>
<i>Red Bull or Mercedes.</i>
<i>It's game on for pole position.</i>
[tense music playing]
[Toto] I don't know what's going on
in the other teams.
We are just sticking to the plan.
We need to push ourselves again.
[Bono] <i>Okay, Lewis. Good to go.</i>
{\an8}[Lewis] Understood.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton's two tenths up</i>
<i>on Pierre Gasly through the first sector.</i>
<i>Hamilton now crosses the line.</i>
<i>He's got pole</i>
<i>with Verstappen trying to stop him.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>Okay, Max,</i>
<i>do what you need to do.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen</i>
<i>matches Hamilton through the first sector.</i>
Max has got
this sort of youthful confidence,
an inner belief.
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen's gone</i>
<i>quickest overall in the middle sector.</i>
[Horner] He's a fierce, fierce competitor
and he's got nothing to lose.
[commentator 4] <i>And Verstappen sets</i>
<i>the fastest time.</i>
[cheering]
[commentator 4] <i>He has sent</i>
<i>the Red Bull garage into raptures!</i>
[Lambiase] <i>Pole position, mate.</i>
<i>Fantastic work.</i>
[Max] That lap was good. [chuckles]
[Horner] Well done, Max.
That's the perfect start.
Well done. Great, great job.
[Max] Yeah, great job, guys.
You all deserve it.
The whole team,
but also back at the factory. Great job.
{\an8}[Bono] <i>Verstappen P1.</i>
<i>Just over three and a half tenths ahead.</i>
{\an8}[Lewis] Sorry, guys. I gave it everything.
[delighted laughter]
[cheering]
[Jacques] How long
do you think this'll be?
[producer] Just two questions to Toto
then we will come to you here, okay?
[Jacques] Thanks, great.
Fuck it. We… We've just got
to keep the smile off his face, huh?
-I mean, that team's never had pressure.
-[Jacques] No, that's the thing.
[Horner] You know, they've never really
had a sustained challenge, like…
-Just gotta keep the pressure on.
-[Jacques] Yeah.
[Toto] We are ruthless
in the analysis of our own performances
and that's why I'm upset,
but the rational me, uh,
is able to channelize that
and take over from the emotional me.
On paper, we are a little bit behind,
but how this is gonna end is not clear.
It's just about tomorrow.
[indistinct background chatter]
[Toto] Ham and eggs.
[in German] With a little bacon
and two pumpernickels,
really toasted so that they break.
Yesterday it was not enough.
It has to be like a cookie. [cracking]
Butter, tomato, salt.
Espresso with lactose-free milk.
And I would just like eggs
and a coffee with cold milk, thank you.
[commentator 3 in English]
<i>It's finally here, a brand-new season</i>
<i>and what a year in prospect.</i>
[Russell] Let's go racing.
[commentator 3] <i>Three new drivers,</i>
<i>four former champions,</i>
<i>ten Grand Prix winners on the grid.</i>
-[man] All right, man? Good? Sleep well?
-[Ricciardo] Good enough.
Good enough to win.
[commentator 3] <i>Have Ferrari found</i>
<i>the pace in their driver pairing</i>
<i>to get them out of the midfield?</i>
-[Sainz] Nice shoes, boy!
-[Leclerc] Yeah.
Beautiful.
[commentator 3] <i>The three rookies,</i>
<i>Nikita Mazepin,</i>
<i>Mick Schumacher and Yuki Tsunoda,</i>
<i>all vying to score points</i>
<i>in their first race.</i>
-[Pérez] Yuki's… he's the man.
-[Ricciardo] Oh my gosh!
-[Pérez] I love that guy.
-[Ricciardo] He's so small. [laughs]
[Steiner] Like every year,
the first race is the most exciting one.
First of all, guys,
don't run into each other.
Don't do anything stupid at the start,
and things like this.
Nobody learns anything.
We just try to put a good race together
and… and finish it.
-[Mazepin] Why are you looking at me?
-[all laugh]
-[Masi] Behave. See you, Susie.
-[Susie] See you later.
[commentator 3]
<i>What an exciting day this is.</i>
<i>It's Red Bull on pole.</i>
<i>Mercedes have got a fight on their hands.</i>
{\an8}-[Horner] Hey. How are you, man?
-Good luck today.
{\an8}-[Horner] All good?
-Yeah. Come on, kick their ass.
{\an8}[Horner]You've wintered well
by the looks of things.
{\an8}Kick their ass today, please.
[Buxton] There's a lot of excitement
in the paddock
that Red Bull have got it right.
[Jacques] Got all
your preseason predictions.
Have you hedged your bets
with another team or not?
-[Karun] No, I'm all in on Red Bull.
-Uh-huh.
-[Karun] Don't fuck it up.
-Uh-huh.
[Buxton] It's a huge moment for the sport
because Red Bull look incredible.
All of the preseason expectations,
all of the preseason hope and hype,
it looks like it might come true.
[commentator 3] <i>Finally it is time.</i>
<i>Finally we can</i>
<i>get the season off and running.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
[Sainz] In Formula 1,
there are no miracles.
Nothing can prepare you.
Like, nothing can prepare you.
[Bottas] You know
that tiny mistake can cost a lot.
{\an8}Who's gonna handle the pressure
and who's not?
{\an8}This sport is cutthroat.
Obviously we're all here to win.
[Leclerc] You do doubt yourself,
but I just need to put the helmet on
and get into the zone.
{\an8}[Yuki] I'm like a tiger,
silently preparing.
{\an8}I don't have any fear.
Emotional.
That's good.
[commentator 1] <i>Five lights on.</i>
<i>And it's lights out and away we go.</i>
{\an8}<i>It's Max Verstappen</i>
<i>against Lewis Hamilton.</i>
<i>They both got away quite evenly.</i>
<i>Hamilton goes into turn one</i>
<i>behind Max Verstappen.</i>
[calls of encouragement]
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>That's off! That looks</i>
<i>like Nikita Mazepin in the Haas.</i>
[Steiner] Oh, fucking hell.
[commentator 1] <i>His first Grand Prix</i>
<i>lasting precisely three corners.</i>
[Nikita] I'm so sorry, guys.
[Steiner] This is fucking madness.
{\an8}[Buxton] Formula 1
is a war on a racetrack.
{\an8}[Urwin] <i>That's Vettel ahead.</i>
<i>We're closing on him.</i>
[Buxton] And every single car
plays its part.
[Russell] Race or defend?
[Buxton] You have to be prepared
to take risks.
[Urwin] <i>Go race.</i>
{\an8}[Adami] <i>Carlos,</i>
<i>you are doing well with tires.</i>
[Buxton] You're not just reacting
to what's happening with your car.
[Sainz] Yeah, I've got more pace
than these guys. Gonna start pushing.
[Adami] <i>Okay, understood.</i>
{\an8}[Buxton] You have to be reacting
to what your rivals are doing as well.
{\an8}[Gasly] For fuck's sake.
<i>I touched the front wing.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>The front wing's gone</i>
<i>on that AlphaTauri.</i>
<i>Gasly is tumbling down the order.</i>
{\an8}[Buxton] Race strategy
can be incredibly complex,
{\an8}but really it's quite simple.
{\an8}How do you get
from lights out to checkered flag
{\an8}in the shortest amount of time possible?
[Lambiase] <i>Box and pit confirm, Max.</i>
<i>Box and pit confirm.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>Every driver has to change</i>
<i>tires at least once during the race.</i>
<i>Newer tires will give you more speed,</i>
<i>but obviously it takes time</i>
<i>to come in and change them.</i>
<i>So these strategy decisions</i>
<i>are absolutely vital</i>
<i>in winning a Grand Prix.</i>
-[machinery whirring]
-[tires squealing]
[commentator 4]
<i>Verstappen's got fresh tires.</i>
<i>Hamilton takes the lead of the Grand Prix.</i>
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Verstappen seven seconds behind.</i>
-[Lewis] Yep.
{\an8}[commentator 4]
<i>Onboard now with Carlos Sainz.</i>
[Adami] <i>Time to go hunting.</i>
<i>I'll leave it to you.</i>
[Mattia in Italian] Carlos has always
made a show about how fast he is.
I guess we'll see.
[commentator 4 in English]
<i>Vettel and Alonso are in Sainz's sights.</i>
<i>And he goes past both of them!</i>
[Adami] Well done, Carlos. Nice job.
[commentator 4] <i>Lap 29.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton leads the Grand Prix</i>
<i>but Max Verstappen</i>
<i>is breathing down his neck.</i>
[Bono] Box, box. Box, box.
{\an8}[Lewis] Tires are okay.
{\an8}[Bono] <i>Box, box.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>Into the pits, Hamilton.</i>
<i>That's a really interesting strategy call.</i>
{\an8}[Lewis] Stopped way too early, man.
Not gonna make it to the end.
{\an8}It's bullshit.
[Toto] The driver will always have
quite a narrow perspective out of the car.
We haven't got a crystal ball,
but we need to plan the moves ahead
and you need to think
what to expect from your enemy.
[machinery whirring]
[tires squealing]
{\an8}[Bono] <i>This is gonna be a long stint,</i>
<i>Lewis, 28 laps remaining.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 4]
<i>What will Red Bull do here,</i>
{\an8}<i>change tires now</i>
<i>or stay out and extend their lead?</i>
[Lambiase] There's still
28 laps remaining.
<i>That would be an almighty stint for Lewis</i>
<i>at this stage.</i>
[Horner] Formula 1 is like
a game of chess.
There are constant dilemmas.
Whoever gets it right
is gonna come out on top.
[Lambiase] <i>We are staying out.</i>
<i>Staying out.</i>
[Max] Yeah, okay.
{\an8}[commentator 4] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>is currently in seventh place.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Can't get
that much more out of it.
{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Okay, mate. No panic.</i>
{\an8}[Brown] He's struggling.
{\an8}[commentator 4] <i>It is only</i>
<i>his first outing in a McLaren,</i>
<i>but he would have wanted to be higher.</i>
{\an8}[Spini] <i>Push flat out, Yuki, flat out.</i>
{\an8}<i>-Get Räikkönen now. One in front.</i>
 -[Yuki] Copy.
[commentator 4]
<i>Impressive race from Tsunoda.</i>
<i>If he can get ahead of Räikkönen,</i>
<i>he'll be scoring points</i>
<i>in his debut Grand Prix.</i>
[Yuki] Whoo!
[cheering]
[Spini] <i>You're doing well, Yuki.</i>
{\an8}[Max] We are losing the rear now a bit.
{\an8}[Lambiase] <i>Okay, copy.</i>
{\an8}<i>Box and pit confirm, Max.</i>
[commentator 4]
<i>Verstappen's tires are wearing.</i>
<i>Red Bull now make a move to change.</i>
<i>So Hamilton is back</i>
<i>in the lead of the race,</i>
<i>but Verstappen has</i>
<i>fresher, faster tires now.</i>
<i>The chase is on.</i>
[dramatic music playing]
[Toto] Strategy's important,
but at some point
it comes down to the two drivers
racing for the finishing line.
{\an8}[Bono] <i>And Verstappen 3.1 behind.</i>
[Lewis] Bono, I know.
Leave me to it.
[commentator 2] <i>And he's locked up</i>
<i>into ten. He's gone wide.</i>
[commentator 1]<i> That is exactly</i>
<i>what Red Bull would want to see.</i>
<i>Hamilton is starting</i>
<i>to really struggle out there.</i>
{\an8}[Lewis] I've got no rear.
[commentator 1] <i>Those tires are</i>
<i>a lot older than Max Verstappen's.</i>
Come on. Come on!
[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton moves</i>
<i>to the middle, forces Verstappen wider</i>
<i>and positions that Mercedes beautifully.</i>
<i>Hamilton's gonna force Verstappen</i>
<i>the long way round.</i>
<i>By the time they get to the corner,</i>
<i>he's about a third of a car in front.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>He's a whole car in front!</i>
-[cheering]
-[crew member] Come on!
[commentator 4] <i>He went all the way</i>
<i>around the outside of Hamilton</i>
<i>and now leads the Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Hamilton down to second.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>Get in there, Max.</i>
[Lewis] He's overtaken
on the outside of the track.
{\an8}[Bono] <i>Copy, Lewis. We'll look into that.</i>
[Buxton] The rules are really clear.
Everybody knows
you cannot overtake off track.
[commentator 4] <i>Look, he took the position</i>
<i>off the track there, Verstappen.</i>
[Buxton] If you do that,
you have to give the position back.
[Lambiase] <i>Max, for the moment,</i>
<i>let Lewis through. Let Lewis through.</i>
[Max] Just let me go, man.
[Horner] We've had the instruction
from Race Control, unfortunately, Max.
<i>Let him through.</i>
<i>We'll get it back.</i>
[Buxton] It's one inch
too deep into a corner,
but it's the fine margins
that win or lose races
and World Championships.
[Bono] Three laps remaining.
[Lambiase] Three more laps.
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen running out</i>
<i>of time to get into the lead of this race.</i>
[crew member] Come on, Max. Get it done.
[commentator 4]
<i>Hamilton is weaving around,</i>
<i>doing everything possible</i>
<i>to keep Max Verstappen behind.</i>
{\an8}[Toto] When you have
Lewis Hamilton in the car,
{\an8}we know that he has
the skill and the determination
{\an8}to overcome whatever strategy
they've thrown at us.
[commentator 4] <i>Hamilton holds on!</i>
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>wins the Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen and Red Bull</i>
<i>take second place.</i>
<i>They were the prerace favorites,</i>
<i>but they've been beaten</i>
<i>by Mercedes tonight.</i>
{\an8}[Bono] <i>Get in there, Lewis!</i>
{\an8}<i>What a job, mate. What a race!</i>
{\an8}<i>Amazing.</i>
{\an8}[Lewis] Whoo!
{\an8}Amazing job.
{\an8}We're not quick enough,
but we managed to do it.
{\an8}That's teamwork.
{\an8}I've been racing a long time
and I've faced a lot of different drivers.
It's constant warfare.
{\an8}Still got it, Bono.
{\an8}-[Bono] <i>Yeah, not bad for an old man.</i>
<i>-</i>[Lewis chuckles]
{\an8}This year I still have that hunger.
{\an8}If anything, I feel
I'm more driven than I ever have before
{\an8}and it's quite overwhelming.
-[man] That feels good, doesn't it?
-[Toto] Oh, I love it. I love it.
The ones that you fight hard for,
where you come from a position
where you don't expect to win,
these victories are… are very satisfying.
[commentator 3] <i>Fireworks in the sky.</i>
<i>Fireworks on the racetrack.</i>
<i>What a brilliant start</i>
<i>to this season's racing.</i>
[Toto] We were the best group of people,
with the right strategy,
the best driver in the car,
and against all odds, won the race.
[commentator 4] <i>This battle</i>
<i>is going to last the whole season long.</i>
[cheering]
[fireworks continue exploding]
[somber music playing]
[Horner] Fuck.
I don't know what else
we could've done. I mean…
Argh!
[producer] Tell me
what it's like to come second.
We fucking hate it.
[chuckles] Um… You know…
Um…
Uh, nobody wants to finish second.
[Max] Of course I'm…
I'm disappointed about today.
[Horner] But we're not gonna back down
from this fight.
We will respond in the best way
that we can, which is on track.
We'll go quicker.
Let's go on the other side
rather than waiting by Mercedes.
We're in this sport to win
and nobody's giving up.
Everybody is fighting.
[man] Round the other side.
[Horner] Everybody believes this could
really start to come alive for us.
[Toto] Don't be too grumpy.
He will be less grumpy
the next time when he wins it.
[Horner] If we pull this one off,
it will be the biggest thing
that we have done in Formula 1.
Second's not part of the plan.
Fucking Mercedes.
{\an8}-[producer] Right.
-Testing three, four, nutsack, five, six.
{\an8}[Brown] Today is the start
of our next chapter.
I predict an array of podiums.
[reporter] How do you see
the dynamic working?
[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris,</i>
<i>another podium.</i>
[Ricciardo] I need to hit something.
[Brown] Holding onto third's
gonna be very tough.
{\an8}[Steiner] Nikita's struggling a little.
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Mazepin off already.</i>
[Haines] He thinks
there's a difference in the cars.
-[tires screech]
-[Steiner] Fucking unbelievable.
[commentator 1]
<i>Verstappen is into the lead!</i>
[Horner] That nearly killed our driver.
He pushes it to the limit and beyond.
[gasping]
[Buxton] It's reached a level
no one expected.
-I could have him in a fight.
-[Toto] No!
[Lewis] This guy's fucking crazy.
[Max] I'm not sure
we can make this to the end.
-[dramatic music playing]
-[Horner yells]
The fight is very much on.
[dramatic music playing]Zak Brown, CEO of McLaren. Rolling.
[classical music playing]
Good afternoon.
Today is a very exciting day
for McLaren Racing,
and the start of our next chapter.
2020 was an outstanding year for us.
[commentator 1] <i>Norris, his teammate</i>
<i>Carlos Sainz cross the line.</i>
<i>McLaren are clinching that third place</i>
<i>in the Constructors' Championship.</i>
-Yeah!
-[cheering]
[Brown] It was a great performance
by both drivers.
[cheering]
It was awesome.
But we were struggling with finances.
[tense music playing]
[Brown] Carlos moved on to Ferrari.
But this season, we have a new driver in…
Daniel Ricciardo.
[shutters clicking]
[producer] Yes, come on!
Big personality.
Got a seven-time Grand Prix winner.
And then we have new investors.
I couldn't be happier
with our new partners.
Given our rich history of success,
the shareholders have one goal in mind.
That is to get back to competing
for the World Championship.
This is gonna be a…
a huge year for McLaren.
[engines revving]
[Ricciardo groaning]
Sorry, guys.
[Stallard] <i>Daniel, we've finished P16.</i>
[Ricciardo] Fuck.
To be standing here now, it's, um…
Yeah, pretty, uh… pretty dark.
-[machinery whirring]
-[engine revving]
[crowd cheering]
[tense music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]
-[man] Come in.
[Ricciardo] No one wants
to touch the handle.
[man] I'll take the risk.
Don't mention it.
-[Sefton] Morning!
-[Ricciardo] Howdy.
-[Sefton] All right?
-[Ricciardo] What's going on?
I'm Daniel Ricciardo and I'm driving
for McLaren Formula 1 team.
{\an8}Might be the first time
I've said that officially.
[Sefton] Let's get this show on the road.
-[Ricciardo] Hello, mate.
-[Brown] What's up?
It's awesome to end up with Daniel.
He's one of the biggest talents
in the sport.
[Ricciardo] Let's go.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>gives Renault their first podium.</i>
{\an8}-[commentator 2] <i>What a performance.</i>
-[Cyril] Woohoo!
{\an8}Daniel is a fantastic driver.
He's world champion material.
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>clinches victory for Red Bull.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] That's another ******* podium.
{\an8}Daniel is one of the best drivers
in Formula 1.
{\an8}He drove some amazing races for us.
[commentator 2] <i>Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>seven-time Grand Prix winner.</i>
[crowd cheering, whistling]
[Ricciardo] Fellas.
-Hi, Taff. How are you?
-[Taff] Yeah, good. Yourself?
-A bit older, but all good.
-[Taff] A bit older?
-Yeah.
-[Taff laughs]
-Bit more mature?
-I hope so.
-[Joseph] Well…
-I wouldn't say that.
[Taff chuckles]
[Brown] Lando going up
against someone like Daniel
really gives him a chance to… to learn.
{\an8}I can't think of a more exciting
driver pairing than… than our two guys.
[Buxton] McLaren enter 2021
with the spotlight firmly on them.
Zak Brown, uh, has new investors,
a new engine in the back of the car,
and now he has Daniel Ricciardo.
{\an8}It's just this groundswell of positivity
{\an8}towards one of the most successful teams
in Formula 1.
[Brown] Given that
we were third last year,
it's pretty important to us
that we finish third this year.
The difference between third and fourth
can ultimately mean
tens of millions of dollars.
Daniel's a very, very focused,
aggressive, uh, individual.
He's a killer in the race car.
[Ricciardo] I've always liked pressure
and, in a way, probably the spotlight.
Do you want it to be called
<i>"Daniel to Survive"?</i>
-[producer] We'll get back to you on it.
-[chuckles]
[dramatic music playing]
[engine revving]
I think, by the end of this season,
I do predict an array of podiums.
An array, does that… I don't know
what that means. It sounds right.
[machinery whirring]
[upbeat music playing]
[Norris groans]
-Yeah, you've had a shocker there, mate.
-Shut up.
Oh, it's going right.
-It went straight. What?
-[Norris] Straight into the trees.
[Fewtrell] If you hole this,
you'll get a podium this year.
{\an8}-Oh my gosh!
-That's a real shame.
[Norris] I'm gonna shunt
in every race. [clicks tongue]
I'm in F1 for three seasons now.
Coming to the end of a contract.
This is the year you have most pressure.
{\an8}You don't where you're gonna be next year,
if you'll even be in Formula 1.
You don't need to film this bit.
It got really, um, windy and, uh…
It just blew my ball all the way
to the left out here. Damn wind.
So how are you feeling about Danny Ric
this season, mate? Confident?
He's obviously a good driver.
Seven-time… Seven-time winner?
[Fewtrell] I got faith in you, buddy.
It's not like
he's really fast or anything.
[Norris] Your teammate
is the guy you wanna beat.
And with Daniel,
I'd like to see
where I stack up against him.
Why does everyone see him
as such a good driver?
It's a bit left.
Too much pressure. [chuckles]
[Fewtrell] There's gonna be more pressure
his year, mate, so get used to it.
[both snicker]
[tense music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Formula 1 is back</i>
<i>and it starts right here</i>
<i>with the Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>
Cops, cops, cops everywhere.
-Mate, they won't catch you.
-[chuckles]
{\an8}It's not like
the car stands out at all, huh?
[Italiano giggles]
[both chuckle]
Hey, it goes all right, eh?
-Yeah, it does. Bit of a kick to it.
-Little bit of a… [clicks tongue]
-Day one of 2021 <i>saison.</i>
-[Italiano] What does that mean?
[Ricciardo] Season? <i>Saison. </i>I don't know.
-Lift up.
-[Italiano] Oh yeah. Nice.
-[Ricciardo] Suicide doors! Suicide doors!
-Fancy. [laughs]
I feel really good to be sitting here, um,
knowing we've got a full season ahead.
If I don't feel
I can be a championship contender,
then I honestly don't think
I'd still be here, so,
yeah, it… it… it fuels me and it feeds me.
[upbeat music playing]
-[man 1 in French] Hello, Pierre.
-[in English] Hi.
-[man 2] Hi, Max.
-[Max] Hello.
[Steiner in German] You again!
-Yeah, and?
-[Steiner] Did you gain weight?
[man 3 in English] You have one
of my favorite phrases in all motorsport.
-[Ricciardo] Okay.
-[man 3] "Let's fuck shit up."
[laughter]
[man 3] You gotta write that down, man.
Appreciate that, man.
-[Nikita] Hi, guys.
-[man 4] Morning, Nikita.
Red Bull Racing Honda driver here.
Hi. Checo Pérez, Red Bull driver…
[chuckles awkwardly]
It says, "Finish with a smile." [laughs]
[reporter] How do you see
the dynamic working?
Lando's been there three years,
but Daniel comes with a certain--
[Brown] He's got a gravitas to him. Yeah.
Two great personalities. Different. Um…
[Buxton] For a team like McLaren,
watching how that dynamic works
is going to be fascinating.
A lot of people might assume
that parachuting in a race-winning driver,
one of the best in the sport,
would be a guaranteed route to success,
but it's really not that simple.
[Ricciardo] Morning.
[Buxton] Formula 1 has countless examples
of big-name signings,
that big-name being
their poster boy for the future,
but it just not working out.
-[Ricciardo] Hi, Ted.
-[Ted] Hello. Who's that?
-[Ricciardo] Uh, Carlos Sainz.
-[laughter]
[Ricciardo] Eh… McLaren, uh, <i>muy bien.</i>
[mocking laughter]
[Gow] Ferrari have also made
their big-name signing,
{\an8}tempting Carlos Sainz away from McLaren.
{\an8}They're hoping his pairing
with Charles Leclerc
{\an8}can bring success to the Italians.
-[Leclerc] Looking forward to it?
-[Sainz] We're nearly there, no?
-Half a day more of interviews.
-[chuckles]
[Norris] It's weird
seeing Carlos in red. It is.
I guess two years
kind of working with him,
my first two years in Formula 1,
you know, we're good mates and everything.
[Sainz] You deserve it.
[producer] What do you think
motivated him to go to Ferrari?
Pure cash.
[chuckles]
Wanna walk back in there, mate?
Sure you don't wanna walk
in that direction?
-[high-pitched] Yeah, you do. [laughs]
-[laughs] No.
-[Norris] All right, see you on track.
-See ya.
{\an8}I think I'm gonna enjoy it a lot,
{\an8}just fighting my old team
and my old teammate.
We are a much more solid team
than what we were 11 months ago, so…
So I'm happy and pleased about this.
[dance music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>It's time for qualifying.</i>
<i>Just who is gonna come out on top?</i>
[man] Good luck.
[Brown] All right, showtime.
-Thanks, man. This is it.
-[Brown] Oh, this is it.
[Seidl] Good luck
for your first ever qualifiers.
Cheers. Cheers, geezer. [giggles]
[Brown] I put a tremendous amount
of pressure on myself,
so, uh, I know what shareholders
and everyone on the race team expects.
The team championship
requires two cars on a very regular basis
bringing home as many points
as… as possible.
So, uh, I'm nervous every start,
I'm nervous every pit stop,
I'm nervous on every pass.
It's gonna be exciting
and nerve-racking all at the same time.
[Seidl laughs]
[engine revving]
[commentator 3] <i>It's Zak Brown's</i>
<i>first opportunity</i>
<i>to see how his new driver lineup</i>
<i>performs out on track.</i>
[edgy music playing]
[Joseph] <i>So, Lando, ready</i>
<i>for the best timed lap we can.</i>
{\an8}[Norris] Yeah, I got it.
<i>-</i>[commentator 4] <i>Oh, understeering.</i>
<i>-</i>[commentator 1] <i>He's lost time.</i>
[Norris] Big mistake, turn 13.

<i>Norris under pressure then.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Norris across the line.</i>
<i>Not that great a lap time.</i>
<i>Now it's all eyes</i>

<i>Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Ricciardo's never been</i>
<i>out-qualified by a teammate in Bahrain.</i>
{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Okay, buddy,</i>
<i>compared to Lando, good start.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Okay.
[tense music playing]
[man] Very close.
-[Brown] Pull it back.
-[man] Super close.
[commentator 2] <i>Will Ricciardo beat Norris</i>
<i>in his first outing in the McLaren?</i>
<i>He does!</i>
[upbeat music playing]
[cheering]
[Stallard] Daniel,
you've qualified P6, mate. Good job!
-[Ricciardo] All righty.
-[Stallard] <i>Pretty happy with that.</i>
[Ricciardo] Nice.
We hit the ground running. Thanks, guys.
[Brown] Well done, guys.
Good start. Good start.
I'm not surprised in the slightest.
Daniel's a great racing driver.
I feel like we'll take
a step forward this year.
[Ricciardo] Yeah, boy.
-[Italiano] Attaboy.
-[Ricciardo] Yeah, boys.
-[Italiano] Good start, mate.
-[Ricciardo] Yeah, yeah!
[Italiano] Good, man.
Could dance from there.
[Ricciardo] Far out.
[Buxton] Daniel, the only 2020 F1 driver
that's out-qualified his new teammate.
[Ricciardo] Yeah, it was…
I mean, that's a nice, let's say, tick.
Maybe it's the, uh, the 31-year-old in me.
I don't know.
[Sefton] You were so close.
-So close.
-[Norris] Yeah, sure.
[Berryman] How is he?
{\an8}[Sefton] He said, and I quote,
"1-0 down already. Fuck, shit, fuck."
{\an8}[Berryman] Ah.
{\an8}[inaudible]
{\an8}-[Norris] Charlotte, don't say it.
-What?
{\an8}-[Norris] That it was close.
-It was!
[man] Mr. Carlos Sainz.
Hey.
-[Sainz] Slow down, okay?
-[laughs]
[Sefton] What do you want me
to say from now on?
-"Oh, mate--"
-[Norris] "You're shit, Lando."
"Go get a new job."
[Sefton] "We knew
Daniel was gonna be better."
[Norris] I'd prefer that.
[laughter]
[upbeat music playing]
[Brown] Morning, guys.
Here we go again.
-[Coulthard] How are you? Oi! Hey!
-[Toto] Congratulations. We're all proud.
[Coulthard] Thank you very much.
-[Horner] Children okay?
-[Carola] Perfect, thank you.
-Good.
-[Carola] Yes.
We have to get them together
at some point.
[Horner] Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely. Yeah, yeah.
-[server] Carrots and hummus.
-[Ricciardo] Carrots and hummus.
-Thanks, Phil.
-[man] Are you good? Sleep well?
Um… Not bad. Good enough.
Thanks, mate.
[tense music playing]
[Malvern groans]
-[Norris] Let's fuck shit up. [laughs]
-[Malvern] Fuck shit up. [retches]
[commentator 3] <i>First race of the season,</i>
<i>the one we've all been waiting for.</i>
<i>The hotly-anticipated Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>
-[Ricciardo] All good?
-[Brown] All good.
What's your pre-race ritual? Music?
[Ricciardo] Music.
-We'll do some, like, reaction lights.
-[Brown] Yeah.
[Ricciardo] And then just music. Yeah.
-[Brown] So I can fuck off any time now?
-[Ricciardo laughs]
Our goal, of course,
needs to be to retain third.
So it's critically important
that both drivers work well together
and have a healthy competition.
Key thing there is
you need to keep it healthy.
Right. It's about showtime.
-[man] Good luck.
-[Brown] All right.
[Stallard] <i>Daniel,</i>
<i>green light is in 30 seconds.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Okay. Radio is good.
{\an8}-[Norris] Radio check.

{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Okay, let's see what we've got.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Norris gets</i>
<i>the better start.</i>
{\an8}<i>The McLarens are side-by-side.</i>
[man] Don't go
taking yourselves out, lads.
[commentator 3] <i>Can Norris</i>
<i>go around the outside?</i>
[Norris] He forced me off.
[commentator 2] <i>The two McLarens battling</i>

[commentator 1] <i>Norris is gonna</i>

<i>And they're gonna go wheel to wheel.</i>

<i>Lando Norris has gone ahead!</i>
[Joseph] <i>Nice job, mate. Nice job.</i>
{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Daniel, now it's your turn.</i>
<i>Let's get stuck in.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Yep.
[commentator 2] <i>Back comes Ricciardo.</i>
[man] He might nick this.
[commentator 1] <i>Norris will force him</i>

[commentator 2] <i>The McLarens</i>

{\an8}[Norris] Yeah.

[commentator 2] <i>Norris, all the way up</i>
<i>to fifth. Can he get up into fourth now?</i>
[Joseph] <i>This is Plan A, maximum pace.</i>
[Leclerc] I'm getting overtaken.
[commentator 2] <i>And the McLaren</i>
<i>breezes past the Ferrari.</i>
[man] Look at that!
[Seidl] Come on!
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Joseph] <i>Good job.</i>
-[Norris] Yeah, I'm happy.
{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Two tenths slower than Lando.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Understood. Just hanging on
to both axles at the moment.
Can't get that much more out of it.
I'm gonna start being vulnerable.
[commentator 2] <i>Here comes</i>
<i>the Red Bull of Sergio Pérez</i>
{\an8}<i>down the inside</i>
<i>and he overtakes Ricciardo.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Ricciardo just hasn't got the pace.</i>

{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Lando Norris</i>

{\an8}-[Joseph] <i>Well done, mate. P4.</i>
-[Norris] Are the fireworks for me?
[Joseph] <i>They can be.</i>
[delighted whooping]
[Brown] Nice job, guys!
[commentator 3] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>comes home in seventh.</i>
{\an8}<i>Not the ideal start for the Australian.</i>
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Stallard] <i>P7, Daniel. P7.</i>
-[Ricciardo] Cheers, guys.
{\an8}Obviously, I'll, uh…
I'll learn a bit from today.
You looked punchiest.
Like you had the biggest ego on the grid.
[Norris] I mean, I'm happy,
because, um, I mean, I beat my teammate.
-That's always nice.
-[man laughs]
Yeah, there's plenty to, um…
Plenty to feed back on.
-[Italiano] Couldn't find the pace, huh?
-No.
[Buxton] Look, it's impossible
to judge a new driver
on the first race
at the start of a new season.
-[Seidl] First one under the belt.
-[Ricciardo] Yeah.
Uh… It was pretty slow, but…
but, uh… Yeah, I'll just learn from here.
[Buxton] But Zak will be hoping
that the Daniel Ricciardo he wanted
starts to emerge over the next few races.
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Stallard] <i>Daniel, car behind is Lando.</i>
-[Ricciardo] Yep.
{\an8}[Norris] I have a lot more pace in me.
[Stallard] <i>Daniel,</i>
<i>we want to swap positions.</i>
{\an8}<i>We need to see Lando's pace in clear air.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Okay.
{\an8}[commentator] <i>To translate, "I'd like</i>
<i>to get past my teammate, please."</i>
<i>"Could you tell him to move over?"</i>
{\an8}[Joseph] <i>Lando. that's P3.</i>
<i>Great job, mate. Well done.</i>
{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Daniel, P6.</i>
<i>I'd say we've got a bit of work to do.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Understood.
{\an8}For every driver,
if you're not at the level you wanna be
and your teammate
is putting in the results…
[announcer] Well done, Lando Norris!
…you ask yourself the question
of why you're not achieving what they are.
{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Daniel, we finished P16.</i>
<i>We were P16.</i>
{\an8}[Ricciardo] Fuck.
[Buxton] Why you can't get the car
to do what they can.
[Horner] But why is he struggling so much?
It's strange.
-Because he's a lot better than that.
-I know, yeah.
[Gow] Everybody wants to know
what's happened to Daniel Ricciardo.
Everything that you hoped
Daniel would bring to the team
seems to have disappeared.
It's heartbreaking.
[Ricciardo] What's the fine
if I don't do media?
-[man] What's what, sorry?
-The fine?
-[man] The fine?
-If I don't do it.
[man] It's quite a lot. We should do it.
We don't have to go right away.
-Take a couple of minutes.
-[Ricciardo] Yeah.
[man] Work out what we want to say
and then that's all we've got to say.
[Ricciardo] It hasn't been, like,
an electrifying start for me. Um…
It has been tricky
to get up to grips with the car.
It feels like I'm having to…
It's not necessarily learn a new sport,
but, yeah, like, learn a new technique,
and so I'm building up…
muscle memory, if you will.
It's still not… I wouldn't say
it's still coming 100% natural for me.
It's embarrassing.
[Italiano] Chin up. We'll do media
and then we'll get to work, all right?
Just remember something.
How you handle disappointment
shapes what type of person you are, yeah?
[Ricciardo] What if I'm just a cunt?
[Brown] I think Daniel's been
a little surprised
by not being closer to Lando.
That also, I think, shows
just how… how damn good Lando is.
Because of Lando, we're in third.
Ferrari's behind us.
[Ricciardo] Yeah,
to be standing here now, it's, uh…
Yeah, pretty, uh… pretty dark.
[Buxton] Coming into Monaco
and with Daniel Ricciardo struggling,
Ferrari are now closing in on McLaren.
[edgy music playing]
[commentator 3] <i>Stand by for action</i>
<i>around the streets of Monte Carlo.</i>
<i>This is the 67th World Championship</i>
<i>Monaco Grand Prix.</i>
Monaco is the, uh,
crown jewel in Formula 1.
There's a five-point difference
in the championship.
The battle between third and fourth
with Ferrari is gonna be challenging.
-[Leclerc] Ah!
-[Sainz] It's nice. I like this.
[Leclerc] Yeah, it's very nice.
I really like living here.
It's very special for me.
{\an8}Monaco is my hometown,
where I've lived all my life.
I want to win every race. That's clear.
But, uh, Monaco
probably even more so for me,
because I am Monegasque,
um… is on my special list.
[Sainz] It's weird for me to think that
this is where you spend your whole life.
-[Leclerc] Yeah.
-But then you get to race in Monaco.
[Leclerc] Carlos Sainz,
uh, very funny guy.
We are getting on
very, very well together.
We spent a lot of time, uh,
during the off-season together actually
to prepare this year
in the best way possible.
It's very strange for me
to get into the mood of racing
when there's a race here.
[Sainz] Because I guess
you're also sleeping at your house.
-Yeah.
-[Sainz] So it feels like a normal day.
-But then you're also racing.
-[Leclerc] Yeah, exactly.
{\an8}[Sain] Basically, the streets of Monaco
{\an8}go through all the places
that he was when he was a kid.
So I can kind of understand
why this place is so special for him
and why everyone loves him so much.
[Leclerc] This is my first school.
-[Sainz] Where?
-On the left.
With the park all here and everything.
{\an8}[in Italian] If your drivers
are on good terms,
{\an8}if they understand that team goals
come before the individual.
{\an8}Ferrari first.
[Leclerc in English]
We will go around the traffic.
-Thank God you know the streets of Monaco.
-[Leclerc] Of course.
[in Italian] If you beat your own teammate
with the same car,
you have shown your superiority.
But not today.
Today, we have other rivals.
[Sainz] Whoa-oh-oh-oh.
-[man in French] Go, go!
-[Leclerc] Go!
-[man] Go, Charles!
-[Leclerc] Thank you.
[Sainz in English] My God. Thanks.
Thanks for the support.
[Leclerc laughs]
No, I felt the same way in, uh, in Spain.
[edgy music playing]
[Ricciardo] Morning, boys.
-[woman] Hi, guys.
-[Ricciardo] Good morning. How are you?
[Brown] I think we can beat Ferrari.
[woman] Thank you so much.
Four or five races into the season,
they're our, uh,
main competition right now.
-[woman] Good luck today and tomorrow.
-[Ricciardo] All right, thanks. See ya.
[Brown] You know, Daniel's a bit confused
as to why it's not clicked.
It's on him to pick up the pace.
[Gow] Monaco is a real opportunity
for Daniel to prove to Zak and to himself
he is a race winner
and that he hasn't totally lost his way
in that McLaren.
[man] Good luck for the race.
[Buxton] Monaco is
a significant race for Daniel.
It's the race
that means the most to all the drivers,
but it's also the last race
that Daniel won back in his Red Bull days.
Now, Zak just needs to see Daniel
back to his best and winning Grand Prix.
{\an8}I think the… the memories of that day
will always be so vivid, uh, to me
{\an8}and I can close my eyes
and recall pretty much everything.
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Daniel Ricciardo leading</i>
<i>the Monaco Grand Prix.</i>
[Rennie] <i>Keep pushing. Keep pushing.</i>
[Horner] Daniel,
he is a phenomenal driver.
That Monaco victory in 2018,
it was the most amazing race.
All his wins were big wins.
They were big drives.
[commentator 1] <i>It's redemption day</i>
<i>for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
<i>He wins the Monaco Grand Prix!</i>
[Ricciardo] I know
what I'm capable of around here,
so I just wanna live up to that.
[crowd whistling, cheering]
[Ricciardo] Zak's always believed in me
and I want to give him back something
in the form of results, and success,
and joy, and all the rest of it.
-[shutters clicking]
-[Ricciardo] I wanna do that this weekend.
[crowd cheering]
[cheering intensifies]
[Ricciardo] Hey, how's it going?
-[Horner] I watched some of that race.
-[Ricciardo] Mate, I know.
[Horner] How the hell you did that
I will never know.
[Ricciardo] It was, uh…
I dunno, a nice… nice memory.
-[Horner] Good memories.
-I'll never forget.
[Horner] All right. Have a good weekend.
Under that big smile and big persona,
he's as competitive and hungry
as any driver.
Zak needs to see Daniel come back to,
you know, what we know he's capable of.
Winning races.
[chuckles] The fact that Lando's younger…
You know, he's a good-looking young lad,
he's driving the wheels off the car,
he's funny.
[chuckling] He'll hate that.
I mean, it couldn't be worse.
[Seidl] Radio check with the team.
We have, uh, two big news to announce.
Over to you, Mr. Lando Norris.
[Norris] We've come
a long way together so far,
and, uh, we all want to make
that next step to winning races.
I'm happy to say I'll be staying
with you guys another few seasons.
[applause]
-[man] Well done, mate.
-Cheers.
[Buxton] Lando Norris is
the talk of the paddock this morning,
having signed a new contract with McLaren.
[Leclerc] Have you seen
Lando has renewed his contract?
No. They announced--
[Leclerc] This morning.
It's strange to announce it here.
-[Sainz] How long? Two years?
-I don't know.
-They said a multi-year contract.
-[Sainz] I'm gonna text him.
[Leclerc] Ask him. He will tell you.
Now that he's making 20 million a year.
[Leclerc laughs]
[Sainz] What do you want me to text?
[Leclerc] "How many years…
is your new contract?"
I'm gonna put
something like, "Congrats," first.
-[Leclerc] Yeah.
-No?
-It's too direct. [giggles]
-Yeah, congratulate. [chuckles]
[Buxton] There was
a lot of interest in Lando.
You know, Lando's obviously
getting the results at the moment.
And Zak knows
exactly what he let go in Carlos.
So for McLaren to lock Lando in
makes a lot of sense.
[upbeat music playing]
[Norris] See the, uh…
You know the thing talking about Daniel
and me feeling sorry for him?
[Sefton] Yeah.
[Norris] Did you see there's been
bad stuff on it?
[Sefton] Yeah.
[keyboard clacking]
[Gow] All of a sudden,
there's this little story that comes out
that Lando's saying
he has no sympathy for Daniel
because Daniel can't
get to grips with the car.
[Norris] Yeah,
but what I said is just the truth.
I don't feel sympathy for him.
-Why would I?
-[Sefton] You shouldn't.
[Norris] No driver… No driver on the grid
would feel sympathy for another driver.
-[Sefton] Well, just try--
-[Norris] And not talk?
[both chuckle]
[man] The bits I wanna cover off
are this bullshit that came up
about Lando's sympathy, uh, piece.
So I'm just conscious
that someone might have a go
to sort of try and dig in there.
Not either anyone's job
to feel sorry for anyone, basically.
-[Ricciardo] Yeah.
-[man] Um…
We're here to get on with our jobs and--
[Norris] Unless you want me
to feel some sympathy for you.
[Ricciardo] Not really.
[man] If you guys could
shut that down hard, it's done and dusted.
[both] Yeah.
[man] Anything else?
Any questions from you guys?
[Ricciardo] Um… [clicks tongue]
I guess, well, Lando's contract extension.
-[man] Yep.
-[Ricciardo] That's… two years?
[man] We're not gonna… Just say multi.
[Ricciardo] But he still has a second job,
'cause he needs to pay a wage somehow.
It's difficult.
Times are tough.
[Buxton] Everybody expected Daniel
and Lando to immediately click.
For a team like McLaren,
the important thing for them
is lifting the entire team as one.
The drivers have to push
in the same direction,
because there's a great vibe at Ferrari.
Everybody's getting on great,
moving that team in the right direction.
And now they find themselves
in that fight for third place
in the Constructors'.
[tense music playing]
[crowd cheering, whistling]
[commentator 2] <i>It's race day</i>
<i>here in Monaco,</i>
<i>and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc starts</i>
<i>in pole position at his home Grand Prix.</i>
[Mattia in Italian] Monaco is obviously
a special track to Charles.
He's been around the circuit
more on foot than on wheels.
We're in pole.
That's something to celebrate.
In Monaco,
if you look at the track's history,
starting in pole means
a good chance of victory.
[Brown in English]
The fight with Ferrari is, uh, is immense.
In, uh, Monaco, we have to be careful…
given that it's, uh, a street circuit.
You make a mistake by an inch,
you're, uh, you're in the fences.

No.
No.
No.

[commentator 3] <i>Ferrari's hopes now rest</i>

<i>The two McLarens have a chance to increase</i>

[Brown] I think, with Leclerc out,
there could be an opportunity,
maybe extending the gap
between Ferrari and us.
{\an8}So we need to make sure
we capitalize on this opportunity,

every pit stop counts, every start counts.

{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Okay, Daniel, let's go now.</i>
<i>Let's start picking up the pace.</i>
<i>There's a lot of action in front.</i>
<i>A few cars have pitted.</i>
<i>Let's get back in this race.</i>
[Ricciardo] I'm struggling more and more,
so I think I'm only gonna get slower.
This is all it's got at the moment.
I can't see it getting better.
[commentator 4] <i>That's, uh,</i>
<i>extremely bad news.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Carlos Sainz on course</i>
<i>for a podium finish for Ferrari.</i>
{\an8}[Adami] <i>We are P2.</i>
{\an8}-[Sainz] What's happening behind?
-[Adami] <i>Norris behind.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>McLaren have Lando Norris</i>
<i>in third at the moment.</i>
<i>His teammate, Daniel Ricciardo,</i>
<i>down in 12th.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>Yeah, and not far</i>
<i>from catching and lapping Daniel as well.</i>
{\an8}-[Joseph] <i>Car in front is now Daniel.</i>
-[Norris] Yeah, confirm.
[Sefton] Danny's, he's lost the pace.
[Stallard] Daniel, shortly,
you'll get blue flags for Lando.
[Ricciardo] Yep. Just let me know when.
I'll let him go.
[commentator 2] <i>And Ricciardo</i>
<i>is getting the blue flags.</i>
<i>He now has to allow Norris to lap him.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris</i>
<i>waving to Daniel Ricciardo</i>

-[commentator 4] <i>Ooh. That hurt.</i>
<i>-</i>[commentator 1] <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>What a day for Ferrari!</i>
{\an8}<i>They can celebrate, as can Carlos Sainz.</i>
{\an8}<i>Second place.</i>
{\an8}[Adami] <i>P2, Carlos. P2.</i>
{\an8}<i>Monaco podium.</i>
<i>First podium in red. Well done.</i>
{\an8}[Sainz] Yes!
Grazie. <i>Grazie a tutti.</i>
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>
[delighted exclamations]
[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris comes home</i>
<i>to take third and another podium!</i>
{\an8}[Joseph] Yes, mate. Yes, mate. P3.
Amazing. P3 in Monaco. What a job.
{\an8}[Norris] Let's fucking go, boys!
-[delighted cheering]
-[man] What a day. What a day!
[whooping]
[Norris] <i>Fuck, boys!</i>
Woohoo!
Monaco, baby.
Monaco podium. Cheers, everyone.
[Joseph] <i>Yes, mate. Still a long way to go</i>
<i>this year. Plenty more to come, I hope.</i>
-[Brown] Nice! [laughs]
-[man] Hey, you.
[Brown] Nice!
Nice!
[commentator 2] <i>Despite only having</i>
<i>one car in the race,</i>
<i>Ferrari close the gap to McLaren</i>
<i>to just two points.</i>
{\an8}<i>The battle for third is on.</i>
{\an8}[Stallard] <i>That's the checkered flag.</i>
<i>Finished P12, I'm afraid.</i>
<i>Uh, we just need to figure out</i>
<i>what was going on.</i>
[Ricciardo] Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
Obviously painful for everyone.
A bit of a weekend to forget.
Just a shit run,
but, yeah, what do you do?
[Stallard] <i>It's coming, Daniel. I promise.</i>
[Ricciardo] All right. No worries. Thanks.
This sport, it definitely
still has the ability
to rip your heart out
from one day to the next.
[woman] Daniel. Daniel!
[Ricciardo] Sorry, we've gotta run.
Sorry, guys.
-A little, uh, frustrated at the moment.
-[man] Yeah.
[Ricciardo sighs]
I need to go and fucking hit something.
[Coulthard] Lando, I can see
the joy and happiness in your eyes.
Brilliant first podium here in Monaco.
Um… It is. Especially, uh…
[Sainz] Come on.
[Coulthard] There you go, Carlos.
Great to see the brotherhood there.
Now, either Carlos wants
to hurry your interview up
or you guys are just good buddies.
He can wait for one minute.
-[Sainz] No. [laughs]
-This is my glory!
[cheering, whistling]
[Brown] I've never experienced
this situation
where you see one car finishing third
and the other not competitive.
Daniel has… has struggled,
which I think, uh, surprised us
'cause Monaco's kinda his home race.
He's… he's won it before.
He's almost won it a… a couple of times.
So I don't think he, uh, yet
quite feels comfortable with the car.
For sure, that's frustrating.
So this one has thrown us a curveball.
I think holding on to third
is gonna be very tough.
{\an8}[Buxton] This year the British Grand Prix
is the biggest race of the season.
[Horner] We lead the World Championship.
-[reporter] Are you smiling?
-[Max] I always smile.
-We can't afford to lose.
<i>-</i>[commentator] <i>Into Copse Corner.</i>
[Horner] If you want something bad enough,
{\an8}you'll do whatever it takes.
{\an8}-Williams are struggling to score points.
-[Russell] Losing the brakes.
[voice catches] I'm quite emotional.
[Tsunoda] The amount of pressure is huge.
-[Spini] Yuki, push harder.
-[Tsunoda] I am! Shut up!
-[Tost] What is he doing?!
-[Tsunoda] Fuck! Sorry!
[dramatic music playing][commentator 1] <i>Lewis Hamilton wins</i>
<i>the Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>
-[Lewis] Amazing job.
-[cheering]
[gunshots]
[Horner] Losing that first race in Bahrain
was just fucking brutal.
But Mercedes are beatable.
They are vulnerable.
Now it's time for us to show Mercedes
there's no such thing as a good loser.
[crowd cheering]
[Toto] Many teams have tried
to beat us in the past.
It doesn't make a difference
this year against Red Bull.
We've won seven championships in a row.
-[man] Feels good, doesn't it?
-[Toto] Oh, I love it. I love it.
I believe we will make it eight.
Don't be so grumpy.
-[machinery whirring]
-[engine revving]
[peaceful music playing]
[Horner] It's always good
when we get the children together.
-I'm in a stage of having a guinea pig.
-[Horner] Who can I hear?

-Hey!
-Ah-ha-ha!
-No! [giggling]
[smooching]
-How you doing?
-Good.
-[Horner] Yay! Mwah!
-[giggling]
[Horner] Uh-uh-uh-uh. Right, hang on.
Hang on, hang on.
{\an8}If you blow this,
{\an8}and you blow all the things off,
you can make a wish
and whatever you wish for will come true.
-Okay?
-I don't think my wish will come true.
Well, let's…
Ready? After three, give it a blow.
One, two, three.
-[forceful blowing]
-[chuckling]
{\an8}-[Horner] What did you wish for?
-[Olivia] A guinea pig.
-[Horner] A guinea pig?
-[Monty] I wished for a helicopter!
You want a helicopter, you a guinea pig.
What about Max
to win the World Championship?
-[Olivia] That's your wish.
-Oh! [chuckles]
-[Monty] That's your wish!
-It is.
-Watch out!
-[Monty] Whee!
[Horner] I spend
a lot of time away from home.
You say to yourself,
"It better be worth it."
Because it hasn't been easy since Bahrain.
Mercedes have completely dominated.
We've finished second
in three of the last four races.
It's vitally important
for us to strike back in Monaco.

-[Leclerc in French] Bonjour.
-Push the bicycle.
Yes, of course. No worries.
[in English] It's a race I've watched
since I'm a child, since four years old.
It is a very special track for us drivers.
A very intense one.
{\an8}No room for mistakes and to be
one day winning there will be crazy.
[commentator 2] <i>This is the race</i>
<i>we've all been waiting for.</i>
<i>The street circuit</i>

[reporter] Are you saying
Hamilton has been?
{\an8}[Ocon] Did you lose Lewis Hamilton?
[reporter] We're ready
to do Lewis, not you.
[Ocon] What's Lewis's question?
"How do you feel about leading
the World Championship?" Pretty good.
[chuckles]
[fans screaming]
[fan] Lewis!
{\an8}It's been a really good start
to the year, but it's not my first rodeo.
{\an8}I've been here a long time. [chuckles]
I know how hard it is to win.
I can't take anything for granted.
[commentator 2] <i>This has been Hamilton's</i>

-How are you today, sir?
-Pretty good. How are you?
Good. Thank you.
Can you go around the yacht?
Go over the waves. Doesn't matter.
Go flat out.
Go all the way.
Now we're talking.
We know the combination
{\an8}of the best team with the best driver
scores the big results.
But we mustn't rest on our laurels,
nor have any sense of entitlement.
-[man in French] You good?
-[Toto] Yes, thanks.
[man] It'll go well?
-[Toto] We hope so.
-Yes, we believe it will!
[Toto] Thank you.
[in English] What do you reckon?
[Susie] It'll all be about the driver
that gets the lap in qualifying.
{\an8}In Formula 1, winning championships
is about momentum.
{\an8}Winning becomes easier the more you win.
It becomes part of your DNA.
To get it, you need to focus
on every session.
It's a long championship. Small moments
will make the difference in the end.
[Toto] Flat out.
[edgy dance music playing]
[commentator 3] <i>It's qualifying day</i>

-We need to do some measurements.
-[Jack] Okay.
[Pérez] Hey, man.
[Jack] Will, did he always complain
about the size of his suit

-[Will] Complained about everything.

[man 3] Okay. We'll have a look.
[machinery whirring]
[Horner] They spend an enormous amount
of time looking at what we do.
[man 4] Good.
They're getting worried then.
[Horner] Prost was telling me a story
about your dad.
-Gave him a lift to, uh, the airport.
-[Max] Oh yeah?
[Horner] And he scared him so much.
He said, "I made him stop the car
because I couldn't cope anymore."
-[Max] Wow.
-[Horner] Yeah.
Max is a born racer.
He's the only driver on the grid
capable of taking on Lewis Hamilton.
He's driving with such confidence,
composure, aggression.
But to win here,
sometimes all you need is a bit of luck.
I saw Mattia yesterday. It looked like
Ferrari were in the sweet spot.
{\an8}[Max] I spoke to Carlos. He was like,
"Fuck, I had so much front end!"
{\an8}-[Horner] Yeah.
-They're close.
{\an8}-[Horner] Just got to get clean laps.
-Yeah.
[Horner] Monaco's been a good track
for us in previous years,
but it's not been
a happy hunting ground for Max.
It's one for him to conquer.

This weekend, I've got to work harder.
-[reporter] Lewis was all over the place.
-[Horner] Yeah.
We're disappointed with second.
He must be fucking mortified with seventh.
I think we know very well
why we've under-performed.
Our car doesn't like
twisty, slow corners at all.
Lewis qualifying seventh was a disaster.
[Horner] This is what amazes me
about Monaco.
You've got all the money here,
then you've got this guy.
How does he get in?
[Toto in German] An espresso,
an egg and a dark rye bread.

-Pumpernickel or some of that sort.

this strategy meeting?
[Susie] If you don't mind, yeah.
[man] <i>Looking at a single lap,</i>

[Geri] Amazing.
-[Horner] Let's look at the Constructors'…
-[Geri] What is it?
-One point--
-[Horner] One ahead?
-Yeah.
-[Geri] One point ahead! Whoo!
[Horner] Suddenly, we're in the lead
of the World Championship
for the first time in Max's career,
and leading
the Constructors' World Championship
for the first time since 2013.
It's a big race to win.
You can feel the season coming alive.
After a few laps, you were cruising.
Amazing. It's been a crazy day really.
-Just got to keep the pressure on now.
-[Max] Yeah.
[Toto] We lacked the pace all weekend.
You have to take it on the chin.
I'm not satisfied with bad performances,
and Monaco wasn't good.
[Horner] That was all right!
You know what that feels like.
[Toto] Valtteri was on course
to finish second
if we hadn't had
the longest pit stop in Formula 1 history.
And Lewis wasn't competitive.
I'm going to look at the data
and find out.
[Rosberg] I don't want to be an engineer
if the boss himself
is looking at the data.
[Toto] You're rarely coming back
from a race that you have won
saying, "Why the hell did we win?"
But if you lose, you go back and say,
"Why the hell did we lose?"
And you dig deeper.
This is why a tough competitor
is also gonna make you better.
[birdsong]
[Geri] In Monaco,
I felt so proud of you the other day.
{\an8}It's the first time
Max has ever led a championship.
He's got nothing to lose.
Lewis has got seven World Championships.
-He's got everything to lose.
-Yeah.
[Horner] Sometimes, you just need to win
a race to start to build momentum.
Getting off the line can be
the most difficult part of the sport.
Toto, he's got a lot to lose.
This is the first time…
He's had a little bit of pressure.
[Horner] Winning Monaco
was a massive result.
We have to build on that
if we're gonna come out on top.
We have to keep
that momentum going from here.
They're on the ropes.
We've just gotta take them down.

<i>wins the French Grand Prix!</i>
-[cheering]
-[Horner] <i>Well done, mate. Payback!</i>
[Lewis] I'm definitely struggling.
[commentator 2] <i>For the fourth race,</i>
<i>Red Bull look unstoppable.</i>
[Bono] <i>Verstappen, 9.9.</i>
-[Lewis] What time did you say he did?
-[Bono] <i>9.9.</i>
[Lewis] Can't match that.
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen wins</i>
<i>the Styrian Grand Prix.</i>
[Max] The car was on fire today.
[commentator 1] <i>The Dutch fans came.</i>
<i>They saw. He conquered.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>And that is now</i>
<i>five wins in a row for Red Bull</i>
<i>as Verstappen crushes the opposition</i>
<i>once again at the Red Bull Ring.</i>
-[Max] Even better than last week.
-[Horner] <i>Keep turning that screw.</i>
-[Lewis] How many points did we lose?
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>14 point hit.</i>
[Lewis] <i>I don't know what to say, guys.</i>
Today, they were simply
in a league of their own.
Our car was so far
off the pace of Red Bull.
[commentator 3] <i>You have to think</i>
<i>if Verstappen wins at Silverstone,</i>
<i>it could spell the end of Hamilton's hopes</i>
<i>for an eighth world title.</i>
[Susie] Which one would you like, Jack?
The almond or the <i>pain au chocolat?</i>
[Jack] I can take both.
[Susie] Both?!
-Do you know where we're going today?
-Where?
[Sally] We're going to…
-The racetrack.
-[Susie] The racetrack.
Who are we gonna watch?
Papi.
[Susie] There's gonna be lots of people
at the racetrack.
Yeah. Busy, busy, busy. [chuckles]
{\an8}[Susie] Yeah, busy, busy, busy.
-[Sally] How's your croissant?
-Good.
-[Toto] Oh!
-[all laughing]
[laughter continues]
[Toto] The most important thing
in my life is my family.
But Susie knows
I have a responsibility for Mercedes
and the 2,000 people
that… that work in Formula 1.
[in German] Who will you be supporting?
-Lewis.
-[in English] That's the correct answer.
[Toto] Ten out of ten.
[laughter]
-[Jack] And we have to beat the red ones.
-[laughter]
Yeah. It's gonna be tough to win, Jack.
Losing to Red Bull so many times
is a real shocker,
but it is not the end.
History proves that multiple
world champions must never give up.
[tense electronic music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>Welcome to sunny England…</i>
<i>where Formula 1 fans</i>
<i>are back in full force</i>
<i>for round ten of the World Championship.</i>
<i>And what a weekend they have in store.</i>
<i>They are seeing a titanic battle</i>
<i>for Formula 1 supremacy.</i>
-Can I get a picture?
-[Leclerc] Sure.
[woman 1] Hurry up. It's my turn next.
[woman 2] Would you mind signing this?
I've got some hand sanitizer if it helps.
[Ricciardo] She was prepared.
[Russell] Is it busy or not?
[woman 3] Yeah, so we should have fans
in the grandstand.
-[Russell] About time, eh?
-Yeah, I know.
[Angela] C'mon, Roscoe.
Going straight to engineering?
-[Lewis] Yeah. You taking Roscoe?
-[Angela] Yeah.
[Buxton] This year, the British Grand Prix
is the biggest race of the season
because it's the first full capacity crowd
at an F1 race
since the start of the pandemic.
And it's the first time
we've had fans here for two years.
Lewis is gunning
for an eighth World Championship.
Home turf for him.
{\an8}But Red Bull
have turned this season around.
Lewis is going to need
everything these fans can give him.
-[Susie] There's 140,000 this weekend.
-Something like that.
[Susie] That's fantastic.
[Jack] I hope Lewis will win again.
Yeah. I hope he will.
Toto is... is incredible,
how he just soaks up pressure.
The more pressure and the more stress,
the more focus he gets.
He has a strength within him which
he can find in the toughest of moments.
He just never stops fighting.
[Horner] I'm gonna have to speak to Fiona
to meet me outside like this.
-[woman] See. I give the VIP treatment.
-[Horner] The VIP treatment.
Coming into Silverstone weekend,
we are absolutely
right in this championship.
We're 44 points ahead
in the Constructors',
and 33 ahead in the Drivers'.
For Mercedes, this race is critical.
[reporter 1] Is your greatest challenge
if you can come back from this?
What's tough is that It's been
the first time really in eight years
where you're just lacking the pace.
But in any case,
this fight is far from over.
It is clear
that we've lost a lot of valuable points
and we must fight back
and reestablish the pecking order.
We can't afford to lose.
[patriotic music playing]
[crowd applauding]
-[Russell] Gonna get a sore arm.
-[chuckling]
-[woman] Danny!
-[man] Danny Ric's a legend!
[cheering]
[thunderous applause]
[Max] I have a lot of respect for Lewis,
but we race hard.
I mean, I don't think
it should be anything else.
[reporter 2] Respect can manifest itself
on track with a driver backing off.
"It's Lewis Hamilton!"
"You take the space you need."
You don't do that.
[Max] Only a weakling would do that.
Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton,
they're polar opposites.
Lewis is an incredibly clean racer.
He rarely gets himself
into controversies or scrapes.
Max… Very aggressive.
He's the young contender
stepping up to the old guard.
And he's getting his elbows out.
But you don't want to push
Lewis Hamilton's back up against a wall,
'cause he'll come out swinging.
{\an8}And over the past few races,
{\an8}he's had one of the biggest challenges
he's ever had to face.
With a car that isn't as fast
as he's used to.
[engine revving]
[machinery whirring]
[Lewis] They've got, like, three or four
of these here on the side.
There's a big vane right here.
Then right at the back here,
they have all these bits sealed.
[Toto] They've sealed them?
[Lewis] They've got aluminum pieces,
so they've definitely added.
Oy, oy.
Gives me nightmares, Baku.
It fucked me up.
[Toto] Just reduce our mistakes
and we're five points ahead.
[Lewis] Baku, fucking hell.
Ah fuck.
[Toto] Don't worry.
[Buxton] He has a mountain to climb
to swing the momentum back in his favor
going into Silverstone.
There's a lot on his shoulders.
[tense music playing]
-[woman] Give me the bag.
-[man] So many though.
[Lewis] What are you doing
with those cards? I'm not--
[woman] No, we're chucking them
once you're gone.
[Lewis] Oh God, this gives me anxiety,
seeing so many people.
Catching COVID was the worst experience
probably of my life.
You have to take precautions.
Why are the people so close?
If I want to win a World Championship,
I can't afford to miss a single race.
I've lost a World Championship
by one point.
I never want to be in that position again,
and I'm still a long way behind.
How you guys doing?
[cheering]
[reporter] The fans behind you.
It's a track you do so well at.
You must be so excited.
[Lewis] It means so much to me,
the support I've had here.
You want to be the one
to raise the Union Jack for the fans.
It's, like, the most proud moment
an athlete can have.
But with all of that expectation
comes the pressure to deliver.
I really hope I can bring it home
for you this weekend.
[cheering]
[crowd chanting] Lewis!
Lewis! Lewis! Lewis! Lewis!
[ominous music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>British Grand Prix.</i>
<i>No matter what happens</i>

[Max] Yeah, radio check.
[Lambiase] <i>To the grid, Max, to the grid.</i>
<i>Get a feel for the balance now.</i>
[Lewis] I think Max is aggressive as hell
more often than not.
He pushes it to the limit and beyond.
{\an8}I've raced against a lot of drivers.
There's always bullies.
{\an8}That's not how I operate.
I just try and beat them on track.
[engine revving]
[Bono] Remember to focus. Let's focus.
[man] Lewis, come on. You can do it, mate!
-[Bono] Make sure you don't go too mad.
-[Lewis] Agreed.
[Horner] I suspect
this one might get a bit fruity.
Lewis is a ruthless racer.
You're not a seven-time world champion
by not having that killer Instinct.
He'll use everything within his armory.
[Toto] A driver needs to be
a lion in the car,
and Lewis is a fighter.
Even if he's knocked down,
he's gonna fight back.
He will always wait for his moment.

[Lewis] I was ahead going in there.
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Yeah, copy, Lewis.</i>
-[Lewis] Fully alongside, it was my line.
[Horner] That nearly
fucking killed our driver.
I want him fucking out of this race.
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Let us know what you need.</i>
<i>-</i>[Lewis] I don't know, Bono.
Just turned in on me.
[scattered applause]
[crowd cheering]
[commentator 1] <i>Great to see</i>
<i>Max Verstappen walking away,</i>
<i>but no surprises that he'll be checked</i>
<i>at the medical center</i>
<i>to make sure he's okay.</i>
[Horner] Initially, it's a huge relief
that he's okay.
It then turns rapidly
to an enormous frustration.
[Lewis] Yeah, he turned in on me, man.
If you want something bad enough,
you'll do whatever it takes.
[Lewis] I was giving the guy space.
[Horner] Michael, have you got a minute?
{\an8}[Masi] Hello.
{\an8}[Horner] Yeah, Michael, look,
that's an enormous accident.
And it was 100% Max's corner.
So, you know, as far as I'm concerned,
full blame lays on Hamilton.
I hope you'll deal with it appropriately.
[Masi] Understood, Christian. That's why
it's under investigation by the stewards.
There is obviously two perspectives.
And I will have a certain bias,
but Max has got in the way
with lots of maneuvers
where the other one has bailed out.
It was clear that, at a certain stage,
enough is enough.
{\an8}What we've seen as a fight for the title
{\an8}has now become all-out war.
[ominous music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>The British Grand Prix</i>

{\an8}<i>and Valtteri Bottas,</i>

{\an8}[dramatic music playing]
-[Lewis] He's just pulling away.
-[Bono] <i>Copy.</i>
<i>Looks like we have</i>

<i>-Ten-second.</i>
<i>-</i>[Lewis] Understood.
[commentator 2] <i>So Hamilton has been given</i>
<i>a ten-second penalty</i>
<i>that he will serve at his pit stop</i>
<i>for causing the accident with Verstappen.</i>
[Horner] Ten-second stop and go.
[man] It can't be.
He should be suspended at least.
[Horner] That is bang out of order.
[Bono] <i>We'll serve your penalty,</i>
<i>then change the wheels.</i>
[heartbeat echoing]
[Lewis] It's tough.
Your heart stands still in that moment.
I see my dreams
of fighting for this World Championship
slipping through my hands.

[Lewis] I can't do anything
about what's behind me.
All I can do is drive.
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Norris's car up the road.</i>
-[Lewis] Understood, Bono.
[Buxton] Lewis is a true champion.
When the call is just, "Drive,"
he can turn a switch.
Something clicks
and he goes into another dimension.
[Bono] You are fastest man on track.
<i>Gap down to 0.6 now.</i>
Let's do it.
[cheering, whistling]
Proper, Lewis, proper.
<i>Valtteri is ahead.</i>
-[Lewis] How far are Ferrari ahead of him?
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Leclerc, 13.8 ahead.</i>
-[Riki] Lewis, the car behind now.
<i>-</i>[Bottas] <i>Copy.</i>
[Riki] <i>Team order,</i>
<i>do not fight with Lewis.</i>
[Bottas] Yep.
[commentator 3] <i>Not for the first time,</i>
<i>Bottas makes way for his teammate.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>Now the hunt is on.</i>
{\an8}-[Lewis] What time to catch Leclerc?
-[Bono] <i>31.4.</i>
[Padros] Okay, mode race, full push.
-[Leclerc] What's the gap to Hamilton?
<i>-</i>[Padros] <i>Gap to Hamilton, 3.2.</i>
[Lewis] The desire to win is deep rooted,
from being on the playground
and always the last person chosen.
[chuckling] I was definitely way better
than a lot of the players that I was with.
But I was also
the only Black kid in… in the line.
[Bono] <i>Leclerc ahead, you can have him.</i>
[Lewis] I was like, "I'll show these guys
when I get on pitch."
"I'm gonna score the most goals."
He's picking up the pace.
[Bono] Lewis, you are looking strong.
Just keep it up.
I still feel the same hunger.
If anything, I have more hunger this year
than I think I've ever had.
It's Hammertime.
-[Lewis] Can I catch him?
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Yes, you bloody can, mate.</i>
-[Padros] <i>Okay, mode race, full push.</i>
-[Leclerc] Front tires are dropping.
[Bono] <i>Keep it easy on the curbs.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Remember what happened</i>
<i>at Copse on lap one?</i>
{\an8}<i>Here goes Hamilton on lap 50.</i>
<i>Oh, and he tries to get past Leclerc</i>

<i>Has Hamilton got through?</i>
<i>Yes, he has!</i>
[raucous cheering]
-Yes!
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Get in there, Lewis!</i>

[Lewis] Whoo! [chuckles]
[Leclerc] Fuck!

[commentator 3]
<i>Hamilton will be savoring every moment</i>
<i>as he wins the British Grand Prix!</i>
[Toto] Yes!
[triumphant laughter]
[commentator 3] <i>The 33-point gap</i>
<i>that Max Verstappen had</i>
<i>going into this race</i>
<i>is down to just eight points.</i>
-[Toto] We so needed that.
-[Susie] Well done. Well done!
[Bono] <i>What an amazing drive!</i>
[Lewis] It's epic. Thank you to the fans.
Couldn't do it without you guys.
[Toto] Lewis, we never give up.
We never give up. This is still on.
[Lewis] Damn right.
[Susie] Unbelievable. I can't believe it.
[Lewis] Such a proud moment for me.
[breathing shakily] Yes, man!
-[man] The momentum will change now.
-[Toto] Yeah.
[man] It's gonna come behind us.
This is what we needed.
[crowd chanting] Lewis! Lewis!
Lewis! Lewis! Lewis! Lewis!
[Horner] Lewis got exactly what he wanted.
Maximum points.
Caused a lot of damage
to his main competitor.
It's not a result that he can be proud of.
[Lewis] The rules are when your wheel
is alongside the side part of the car,
it's your line and the other car
has to concede, and he didn't,
so… that's not my problem.
Um…
If you're not going for a gap,
you might as well stop racing.
Today, this weekend, we needed the points,
and there was a gap,
he left a gap, and I went for it.
[Toto] They were side-by-side
and he didn't give him a room,
but Lewis was not there to bail out.
[man 1] It's exactly the right lesson
for Max to learn,
because otherwise,
everyone always backs out for him.
-[crowd cheering, whistling]
-[Lewis] Does this open?
[man 2] Yeah!
[man 2] Woohoo!
[cheering, whistling intensifies]
[Horner] It's a tough moment.
I'm absolutely furious.
It's our biggest rival
that has created the accident
and there he is celebrating,
jumping up and down.
So it's like, "Fine. Okay,
you can play all the games you like,
but we're not gonna be
bullied into submission here."
We're in this fight
and it's all to play for.
[crowd chanting] Lewis! Lewis! Lewis!
Losing must have felt
very painful for Max.
If you put it simply, he had an accident
and it was a 25-point swing
in our advantage.
We won the race.
And I think that it is clear
the battle is far from over.
[crowd cheering, whistling]
{\an8}[Steiner] This year we've got
two rookies in our cars.
{\an8}But because nobody's ever done it
doesn't mean it's wrong.
[reporter] Are we gonna see a softer side
to Guenther Steiner?
-[chuckles]
-[tires screech]
[Steiner] This is fucking madness.
Long way to go
{\an8}There's so much pressure, we cannot relax.
[commentator 1] <i>Brilliant move</i>
<i>from Lando Norris.</i>
George is gonna come after my seat.
Of course I'll fight for it.
[Russell] What the fuck was he doing?
[dramatic music playing][indistinct chatter]
I'm already falling down.
[chuckles gleefully]
-Let's go.
-[man] Okay.
[Steiner puffs with exertion]
[Steiner in English] As a kid,
I had an acquaintance of my dad,
which came up here five, six times a year
and I always wanted to come up with him.
But I was a kid then.
He never would take me.
This year, I decided
this would be a good way
to spend a few days away
from all the hard work,
politics, racing of Formula 1.
[in German] Let's sit down
right here, Johannes.
-[Johannes] Do we want to drink something?
-Yes, sir!
-Cheers. [chuckles]
-Cheers.
[Johannes] How is it going with the team?
It is difficult. I didn't imagine it
to be as difficult as it turned out to be,
but Formula 1 is just so difficult
and there is a big difference
when you have two drivers
that are new to Formula 1.
[Buxton in English] <i>Just this morning,</i>
<i>the Haas F1 team announced</i>
<i>both of their drivers</i>
<i>would be leaving the team.</i>
Last season was a little bit too dramatic,
even for us.
{\an8}-[tires squealing]
-[Grosjean] Fuck!
[commentator 1] <i>And a big fire there!</i>
<i>That was horrendous.</i>
This year, we have got
two rookies in our cars.
[Nikita] He absolutely turned into me.
[Steiner] It never rains, it pours on me.
It'll be difficult.
I know the challenge in front of us.
It's fucking unbelievable.
[commentator 2] <i>One of the debutants' race</i>
<i>is over before it's even begun.</i>
[Steiner] But because
nobody has ever done it,
it doesn't mean that it's wrong.
If we are not united as a team,
then we are all going to shit, you know.
We just need to stay together
and survive the season.
It's a long way to go! [giggles]
Long fucking way to go.
[machinery whirring]
[engine revving]
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Here we go.</i>
<i>The 51st Formula 1</i>
<i>World Championship Spanish Grand Prix</i>
<i>and the 31st</i>
<i>to take place here in Barcelona.</i>
[entry system beeps]
[Steiner] I think after here,
we should go three days to Amsterdam.
[man] Hot box it for a week! [laughs]
[Pérez] Too many cameras.
-[man] Famous or something?
-[woman] Morning.
Gonna be getting
a nice little sweat on today.
-[Hamilton] I wanna get on the water.
-[Ricciardo] Still not warm though.
[Hamilton] Fucking freezing.
You need a thick wetsuit.
-[Norris] Love how I've been holding this.
-[man] Yeah!
[Norris laughs] The whole time.
[Ricciardo] Fuck you guys. [laughs]
[upbeat music playing]
[Buxton] Going into 2021,
the Haas could not be more different.
There's no two ways about it.
{\an8}Haas were in financially difficult straits
{\an8}at the end of 2020…
[Steiner] Yeah, making my own coffee.
[Buxton] …and needed an injection of cash
in order to ensure the future of the team
and livelihoods of all of its employees.
That ultimately came in the form
of a Russian fertilizer company
owned by an oligarch.
[ominous music playing]
[Steiner] He's not an oligarch.
He's a fertilizer guy.
[chuckles]
[Dmitry] Are we on the radar?
{\an8}-[Steiner] What?
-On the radar with the movie?
{\an8}Yeah, yeah, yeah. It doesn't matter.
I'm used to it, you know? So don't worry.
We have no secrets, huh?
[Dmitry] No secrets, but I am not hero.
-You are the boss, you are the hero.
-[laughs]
-It's good. I mean, you're the sponsor.
-Yes.
[Steiner laughs]
[Steiner] Mr. Mazepin owns Uralkali,
one of the biggest
fertilizer companies in the world,
you know, if not the biggest one.
{\an8}If we wouldn't have done what we did,
to find partners, to find sponsors,
the chances that we wouldn't be here now
would have been very high.
[Dmitry] I sent you some comments.
I mentioned some suggestions.
[Steiner] Okay, I will write back.
I just need to go do something.
[Dmitry] No rush.
{\an8}Dmitry is heavily involved
in the financing of that team.
This season, he's always there.
[Steiner] All of our sponsors,
they're not here just to give us money
and we can go racing.
They want something out of it.
There's always expectations.
It's just like, "What are they?" You know?
[upbeat music playing]
[Gow] The look of Haas
is very different this year.
The Mazepin money
is definitely showing itself on the car.
[interviewer] Who came up
with the Russian color scheme?
It is not a Russian color scheme,
you know? [laughs]
It could be American, it could be British.
It's always the same colors, you know.
[laughs]
You know that I love a bit of controversy.
[Gow] But the livery
is not the only thing that's changed.
[Nikita] Hey, guys.
Nikita Mazepin, Haas F1 team.
-See you on the track.
-[engineer] Yeah.
[Nikita] My dad is a sponsor now,
uh, of the team.
The relationship with my dad
is… is really unique.
{\an8}I think in… in total,
{\an8}my dad's probably missed,
like, 12 or 15 races,
{\an8}um, and I've had
more than 400 races in my life.
[Dmitry in Russian] Yeah, listen, we need
to have professional relationships,
not just be buddies.
Sure, we're friends,
but we're working towards a goal
and everyone needs to do their job.
[Nikita in English]
Every success and failure I've had,
you know, has always been
our moment together as a family
and he supports me no matter what.
[Steiner] Nikita Mazepin, I think,
is a very good driver.
I mean, a great talent in my opinion.
He could have finished,
with a little bit more luck,
third last year in F2,
and it was a very competitive year in F2.
[reporter] So, you are new to most people
in the Formula 1 world,
but there are people
who have a lot of opinions about you
and about your father
and about your father's money
without even knowing you.
How does that feel for you?
I think criticism isn't a bad thing.
Give me as much shit as you want.
Uh, I'm there to race.
I will race and I'm here to stay.
I think part of my job is recognizing
that this sport
is a sport that likes conflicts
because it makes, you know, the clicks.
Haas's two rookies
are incredibly important for the sport.
-[reporter] Have a good one.
-[Nikita] Thanks for your time.
[Buxton] One, through the sponsorship
that he brings due to his father,
is responsible for the team
still being on the grid
and the other one has
one of the most famous names
in global motorsport.
-So, um, now my name, right?
-[interviewer] Yep.
Okay. Uh…
Mick Schumacher, I'm 22 years old
and racing for Haas.
[Steiner] Mick Schumacher
doesn't need any introduction.
[photographer] Stay there.
His father was
a seven-time world champion.
-[crowd cheering, whistling]
-[celebratory horns blowing]
[Steiner] And Mick is his son
and, uh, comes with a good pedigree.
[Mick] Being there around
and seeing my father work
was, uh, was amazing for me.
He is and always will be
the greatest in Formula 1.
I've won Formula 3
and Formula 2, uh, to do this.
Obviously, the hype has been big,
racing with the Schumacher name,
but I don't think that it's something
that is necessarily on my mind
'cause it's just something
that has always been there.
[man 1] All right.
[in German] Welcome! [laughs]
[Mick] Hello. You good?
-[man 1] Yeah, and you?
-Yeah, thanks.
[man 1] They're doing a photo shoot.
Look here, Guenther
-[Steiner] Ooh!
-I did that especially for you! [laughs]
So let's go upstairs.
-[man 2] Morning.
-[Steiner] Super.
Hello, Mick.
[upbeat music playing]
[in English] It's pretty cool
to have Mick. Being a German driver,
Mick brings a good interest
of German sponsors.
[photographer in German] Very good.
[Steiner in English] Especially when
the driver's Schumacher.
In Germany, the name is still legendary.
[in German] I can't
reach the floor with my feet.
[both laugh]
[photographer] Excellent.
Direct and friendly.
[Steiner in English]
Being in a small team,
it's a challenge to stay afloat.
You just try to do your best
to keep it going, you know?
That's what you have to do.
In the moment, I'm not too proud
to do these things, you know?
[crew members speak indistinctly]
[man 2] Okay, thank you.
[photographer in German]
The other way round, yes.
With the bow to the front.
-The point forwards?
-[photographer] The point there.
Bow. It's "bow" and "stern," right?
-Bow?
-[Steiner] Yeah, right, bow.
Of course you don't
have to actually sit in it.
[Steiner laughs]
I wouldn't be able to get out of it!
My boat.
[in English] Selling saunas,
selling bathtubs,
selling whatever needs to be,
but it's part of our contracts,
we have to do this.
[photographer in German] Sauna salesman,
the perfect sideline for you.
I sold houses 20 years ago,
so that's why, as you can see.
Alex, my dream has come true.
I am now in an Aldi brochure!
[snickers]
[in English] That's… [chuckles]
Do you think that was the aim of my life,
getting in the Aldi catalogue?
-[interview responds indistinctly]
-[laughs]
[reporter] Hello, Guenther. How are you?
Haas has obviously
never run rookies before.
I'm just wondering
how you're changing your approach.
[Steiner] They are
a fucking bunch of wankers.
[reporter] So are we gonna see
a softer side to Guenther Steiner?
[Steiner] We've got two fucking idiots
driving for us.
This is not acceptable.
We will make changes.
[reporter] How are you adapting
to deal with these rookies?
[Steiner] I… I am adapting. I'm rational.
I'm fully aware
they never did it, you know.
It's like putting them under pressure now
is the complete wrong thing
because you get a counter reaction.
They need to learn, get the confidence.
And then they can deliver.
[dramatic music playing]
Haas is like a family company.
Everybody's very close together.
[man] Ooh! Oh God!
So many bits of me
fucking nearly snapped then.
[Steiner] The most important thing
for us this year is to build a new family.
-[woman] We need one with you and Mick.
-He can come here.
[Steiner] Make them ready for next year
so we can be competitive again next year.
We just need to stay together
and finish the season. [laughs]
[Crofty] The team was saved,
that's the main thing.
[Steiner] Yeah. That's the main thing.
We can build up from here.
[Crofty] It gets expensive for you
if Nikita keeps crashing.
-[Steiner] At some stage it will.
-Yeah.
[Steiner] The beginning of the season
for Nikita wasn't easy.
{\an8}[tires squealing]
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Oh,</i>
<i>and it's Nikita Mazepin off.</i>
[metal crunching]
[gasping]
[Steiner] Oh, fuckin' hell.
[commentator 1] <i>Nikita</i> <i>Mazepin,</i>
<i>his first Grand Prix</i>
<i>lasting precisely three corners.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Oh,</i>
<i>and that's Mazepin in the gravel.</i>
[Steiner] Fuckin' hell.
[commentator 1]
<i>That was Nikita Mazepin giving him a tap.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>He's having</i>
<i>a baptism of fire, is Mazepin.</i>
<i>-</i>[commentator 3] <i>It's Mazepin.</i>
<i>-</i>[commentator 2] <i>Of course it is.</i>
[Horner] Just try
and avoid Mazepin round here.
He's a fucking disaster.
[Buxton] If I could just have
a short summation of your day.
-[Nikita] I don't wanna.
-Okay.
[Steiner] Nikita is struggling a little,
but I think that will go away.
It's difficult to keep people calm,
but that's what we need to do.
If you overreact now,
there's nothing good coming out.
Mick's in a good way.
He's going in the right direction.
{\an8}[Gannon] <i>Checkered flag, Mick.</i>
<i>-Really good drive, man.</i>
-[Mick] Yeah. Car was great. Thank you.
[Steiner] For Formula 1, Mick maybe
is a little bit better prepared,
but still, it's a big change for them.
It's a big step up.
[engineer] Not a very good mood in here.
-[Steiner] What can you do?
-Yeah.
-Keep fighting.
-[Steiner] Yeah.
-[engineer] Good job.
-Thank you.
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 4] <i>Mazepin has qualified</i>
<i>slower than teammate Mick Schumacher</i>
<i>in every race so far this season,</i>
<i>so he'll be out and desperate</i>
<i>to prove a point in Spain.</i>
[Gow] Nikita Mazepin's so unhappy.
He can't get on top of the car,
can't understand how it works.
It's chipping away at his confidence
every time he gets in the car.
Tension is brewing.
There is always pressure
with the title sponsor,
especially when the CEO of that company
is the father of the driver.
The pressure from outside is immense.
Barcelona should be
an interesting weekend.
I think it's a circuit
that I know very well.
I've had the luck
of driving very fast cars here.
I also did very well here
in different junior categories,
and it should be a step forward.
[tense music playing]
[engine revving]
{\an8}[Haines] <i>The rear tire temps look good.</i>
<i>Rear tire temps look good.</i>
{\an8}<i>Fronts will come down a little bit</i>
<i>in the lap.</i>
{\an8}-[Nikita] Got it. Good.
<i>-</i>[Haines] <i>Cool.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
[tires screeching]
[Steiner] This is fucking madness.
<i>-</i>[Haines] <i>Are you okay? Are you okay?</i>
-[Nikita] All good.
[commentator 2] <i>Mazepin coming back</i>
<i>on the track, flicking gravel everywhere,</i>
<i>That's not gonna be very pleasant</i>
<i>for all the other drivers.</i>
{\an8}[Carlsen] Fucking hell.
{\an8}Should be on it here
'cause he knows the track.
That's what he's been saying
the whole time, that he knows.
I'll speak to him afterwards
and see what he says.
{\an8}[Haines] <i>Talk us through</i>
<i>what you felt on that.</i>
{\an8}[Nikita] Asking me for feedback.
I give you the feedback.
{\an8}We do a change,
{\an8}and it does exactly the opposite
of what I'm asking for.
{\an8}So the only thing we've done
is we've gone back.
Why am I also so much slower
on the straight than my teammate?
[Haines] I'll double check. Stand by.
{\an8}[Gannon] <i>Very good Improvement</i>
<i>on that lap, Mick.</i>
{\an8}<i>You did a good job.</i>
{\an8}[Mick] The car was great.
It felt really good. Thank you.
{\an8}[Haines] <i>Good, good.</i>
{\an8}[Nikita] I don't know why you kept
telling me I should improve on lap three
{\an8}because, uh, it's not possible.
{\an8}[Haines] We saw some people were able
to set times later on, that's all.
{\an8}-[Nikita] I was not.
<i>-</i>[Haines] <i>Copy.</i>
[Steiner] Fuckin' hell.
That's why people hate you!
This fucking shit here.
[in Russian] It's simply undrivable.
Everything I did in the other series,
it's impossible now.
It's great to invest in next year,
but I still need to drive it now.
I don't understand how he drives it.
There's not a lot of friends here.
Not a lot of friends, yeah.
Every man for himself.
[Steiner in English] For rookie drivers,
the confidence level
is determined by your results,
obviously, you know,
and for Nikita, uh, sometimes it seems
that he's beaten by Mick.
And when you're beaten,
it knocks you down.
[Nikita] Fucking hell. I was snapping,
understeering, oversteering.
I was doing loads of things.
[Carlsen] It's something we need
to talk about, see if we can do something.
[Nikita] If we change the car,
it makes a difference.
[in German] Great.
[chuckles] Oof!
-[Mick] Yeah, it was real fun.
-[Steiner] Yeah.
[Nikita in English] A general comment. Um…
There's a very big delta
between C1 and C3.
C1 is undrivable for me.
I mean, you're not really racing.
You're really trying to stay on track.
I don't wanna take C3 into account
'cause I don't understand
anything about that tire.
[man] You mean C1?
-Yeah, C1 is undrivable.
-[man] Yeah.
[Nikita] I don't wanna talk about it.
I really don't know the balance--
[engineer] That's fine. Let's focus on C3.
[Steiner] When you are finished,
can we have a chat please?
First of all, I want to tell you
that we really try to help you
but you need to help me as well.
When on the radio, do not be aggressive.
You don't achieve anything.
They are afraid of you.
[Nikita] If I am a pussy--
[Steiner] No, you are not a pussy.
I'm not saying you need to be loved.
I'm just saying
to be very neutral, you know?
Not being, "Oh, this is fucking shit."
That doesn't help anybody, you know.
[Nikita] Being nice about the situation
won't help me fucking stay here.
[Steiner] If we are not united as a team
we are all going to shit.
-[Nikita] I'm really trying to do my best.
-Yeah--
[Nikita] But they're saying I need
to improve my lap time on turn three
because, you know, Mick did it.
[Steiner] But you need to keep on trying.
We are getting you closer to Mick.
I know that is the fucking frustration.
But there is not
a magic thing for this car
and I think Mick can deal with it better.
So what we need to do?
[Nikita] At this moment,
I think that the most beneficial way
that we can do it
is by trying
to make a different car for me.
[Steiner] I mean, it's the same car.
As much as you believe it's not,
it's the same car, you know?
[edgy music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>It's a beautiful day</i>
<i>on the shores of the Mediterranean.</i>
<i>Welcome along to the 51st</i>
<i>World Championship Spanish Grand Prix</i>
<i>and to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.</i>
-Hello.
-[Steiner] How are you?
-A bit pissed off.
-[Steiner] Why again?
-I want to go faster.
-[Steiner] Aye, we all want to go faster.
[Nikita] What's the biggest difference
with our cars?
[Haines] The other car has
slightly lower rear ride height,
giving him slightly more rear end.
[Nikita] Maybe we do that as well?
[Haines] Okay.
F1 is a brutal world to be in
when something is just not going right
and if you look at my results,
it was clear that the car was not drivable
over and over and over again.
[tense music playing]
[Buxton] Every Formula 1 driver
has to believe that they're the best.
That's the mindset.
So if they're not
outperforming their teammate
with the same equipment,
they will question the engine,
the gearbox,
"Do I have the same car?
Do I have the same chassis?"
They will go through every single part
of the car that could be different
before they will focus on themselves.
[Steiner] We give everybody
the same equipment.
They're equal by contract.
That is what it is in our team.
[Mick] This whole drama,
I think it could be superstition.
It's the driver, so he can change the car.
{\an8}Still, if you don't do the right things
on track, you will not be faster.
[Steiner] There's so much pressure
on these young guys
when they come into Formula 1,
so they want to overdeliver,
which is not possible
because the other 18 guys out there,
they're pretty good, you know?
They all believe there is magic.
No. This is no magic, this sport.
This sport is hard work,
fucking dedication--
-[man] And money to keep it all going.
-[Steiner] Yeah, exactly.
If you don't put money in,
this doesn't work.
[commentator 4] <i>It's race day</i>

[commentator 1] <i>Mick Schumacher,</i>
<i>George Russell,</i> <i>Nicholas Latifi,</i>

[Nikita] I don't have much rears.
[commentator 1]
<i>Mazepin struggling a touch.</i>
[commentator 5]
<i>These tires are not enjoying it.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton's coming up to lap Mazepin.</i>
-[Haines] <i>How's the balance?</i>
-[Nikita] Not good!
[commentator 1] <i>He's just gone half</i>
<i>a second slower on that previous lap.</i>
[Haines] <i>If you can push more,</i>
<i>it may help.</i>
[Nikita] I'm driving whatever I can.
[commentator 5]
<i>Oh, this is turning out horribly.</i>
[Nikita] If I push more, it's getting bad.
[tense music playing]
{\an8}[Gannon] <i>Okay, checkered flag, Mick.</i>
<i>Checkered flag.</i>
{\an8}[Haines] <i>Tough race, Maz.</i>
[in Russian] The car's very hard to drive.
The balance is like day and night.
It's something completely opposite.
[Dmitry] Well, listen. I, too, believe
that it's impossible
to have such a difference.
[Steiner in English] When shit happens
it doesn't finish, you know.
[Dmitry] What are you doing with my son?
[Carlsen] I think
the team doesn't know what to do.
[Dmitry] If it doesn't change,
I will send an official letter
that we stop financing and stop racing.
-It will be a huge problem with the money.
-Mm.
-[Dmitry] And they will decide what to do.
-Mm-hmm.
Because we will not keep this,
"Let's do, let's do.
Let's try, let's try."
We already tried three races
and if we remove the Uralkali,
we stop racing.
Switch the cars.
Everybody knows that
someone has advantage.
-[Carlsen] That's why--
-Maybe we will stop racing.
I just wanted to say to you
that Dmitry came
and he said
he was going to pop a formal letter.
[Steiner] About what?
[Carlsen] Withdrawing.
Withdrawing from what?
Formula 1, huh?
Why?
[Carlsen] He thinks
there's a difference in the cars.
He keeps on about that.
Well, we need to get…
We just need to get this…
We need to get on top of this
one way or the other.
[Buxton] Guenther's in
a really weird space this year
because 2021 is about survival for Haas.
It's about making it through
however many races there are in the year
and getting to 2022.
He just needs to keep the team together
and just get to the end.
[Steiner in German]
How high is the Tabaretta?
-[guide] 2,550 meters.
-[Steiner] 2,550 meters, yeah.
[guide] Take it slow.
[Steiner] Okay.
Don't worry. I don't stress myself.
[Johannes] How's it going with Nikita?
And especially with his father?
[Steiner] We have contracts with Uralkali
and hopefully, they will be respected.
But you can't just come into Formula 1
and expect that everything goes
as you wish.
Oh damn!
[in English] It is quite consuming,
you know?
Mentally,
because it's a big responsibility.
We have got a lot of employees
and I feel responsibility towards them.
[Johannes] No fear. No fear.
[Steiner] It's a little bit extreme
in Formula 1.
Whatever you do, any move you make,
it's scrutiny, and that creates pressure.
[in German] The rope
will hold us, won't it?
[in English] You're always on the limit.
You're never in a comfort zone.
[tense music playing]
The summer break gives you an opportunity
to step back and digest things.
Oof!
What I would say for Nikita,
"Do what you need to do
to clean your head out
so you can think clearly again,
digest everything."
"Work it off and out of your system
because to survive,
everybody needs to be united."
[trainer] Nice, man.
Keep it going. Well done.
[Nikita] It's definitely good to go home.
If there's one place where I don't feel
like an F1 driver, it's in Russia.
All the tension that you get
from traveling and racing
and perhaps some difficult moments…
[metal crunching]
[trainer in Russian] Left straight!
Good. Well done. And… Good! Lighter!
[in English] It's very important
to reset and release some steam.
-[thud echoes]
-[wings flapping furiously]
[Nikita] I was stressing out in Barcelona.
-[Carlsen] But not only there. In Bahrain.
-In FP1.
[Carlsen] I don't know,
{\an8}I just think if you're more than a second
off your teammate,
{\an8}there must be something wrong
{\an8}and you were really
just losing confidence.
And then, from…
from just going into the second race,
it kept on going,
and I was getting a bit worried
because there was something
that wasn't right.
[tense music playing]
[clears throat]
[Nikita] Ever since Bahrain,
things really did fall apart.
Formula 1 is obviously a big step up.
You go out there
and you have to be on the limit
and if you overstep it,
that's the difference
between spinning or being in the wall.
Um, if you don't have that confidence,
I'm not able
to extract the potential from the car.
Guenther's definitely been supportive
in times when I think
I did need that support
because I felt very fragile,
but he's also, uh… been very direct
at times when he hasn't been happy.
You know, you're a kid, in a way,
in a very big sport.
Do you feel confident now?
Yeah, I feel really confident. I think…
Like, for me,
Sochi is<i> the</i> biggest race of this year.
And I think I've got
the perfect prep for Sochi.
[Carlsen] This could be one of the races
where anything can happen.
You're competing against your teammate,
so honestly,
I mean, it's a question of
who of you is gonna finish in front.
It'd be nice if you finished in front
of him this weekend. That'd be nice.

-Very busy, man.
-[Ayao] Yeah.
-You know--
-[Ayao] Should be. It's your home race.
-Fuckin' hell.
[tense music playing]
[Buxton] It's a very difficult year
for Nikita, his father,
and the Haas F1 team.
So, to keep the team together,
what Nikita needs from his home race
is no spins, no crashes,
bring the thing home, rebuild confidence,
and just prove that he belongs.
[speaking Russian]
[Steiner] The Russian Grand Prix is
the most important for the Mazepin family.
It is very, very important for them
just to show up there.
Uralkali's a big company in Russia.
It's the first year for Nikita in Russia.
They want to show their countrymen
what they're able to do
and that creates additional pressure,
so it's all… it's all pretty intense.
[tense music playing]
[Steiner] If you have good results,
everybody's always happy,
and I want to keep all our partners happy.
[interviewer] Was there ever the fear that
Dmitry could withdraw that sponsorship?
-I don't want to go there on an interview.
-[interview] Okay.
[commentator 3] <i>Going into Sochi, it seems</i>

[Nikita] I saw the clouds building up
and getting darker and darker
and, I don't know,
the clouds in Russia are different.
I remember leaving from school
and normally, when you see these clouds,
you know that in 20 minutes
the rain's gonna start
and to be honest,
I didn't really think twice.
[commentator 2] <i>Mazepin pitting</i>

<i>-</i>[Joseph] <i>We're gonna come in, box.</i>
{\an8}[Haines] <i>Nice laps, Maz. Nice laps.</i>
<i>Let's keep going like this. This is good.</i>
{\an8}<i>Starting last lap.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Lewis Hamilton,</i>
<i>it's 100 race victories,</i>
<i>he wins the Russian Grand Prix!</i>
[suspenseful music building]
<i>Okay, Maz, that's the checker.</i>
<i>That's the checker.</i>
<i>Brilliant start and opening lap,</i>
<i>and that first stint was really good</i>
<i>defending against faster cars.</i>
[Nikita] Good call on the tires, then?
[Haines] <i>Others didn't do that</i>
<i>as quick as you</i>
<i>and then, as you saw, struggled,</i>
<i>so good job.</i>
<i>Ended up beating Latifi and Mick.</i>
<i>Nice race, mate.</i>
[Steiner] I think Nikita,
he earned his place in F1.
Nikita is getting better
each race, you know.
We can see progress not only in the times,
but also how he works with people
and how he does his job in Formula 1.
Thank you. Cheers.
-[Ayao] Very happy. Yeah.
-[Dmitry] Yeah.
[Dmitry] Race by race, he becomes calmer.
-[Ayao] Exactly.
-Yeah.
[Haines] Really positive. Um…
Really, really good.
-Yeah.
-[Dmitry] Thank you.
We believe in each other.
We can only get better
from where we stand today
and, uh, we'll do it.
-Thank you.
-[reporter] Thank you.
[notification chirps]
[strong wind blowing]
[triumphant music playing]
[Steiner in German] You learn
from the most difficult situation.
And I also say that to young people.
It is not how you go down,
but how you come back.
[in English] If I would have known
how difficult it was,
maybe I wouldn't have done it.
In F1, you don't really know
what is coming next.
Always that risk element is involved.
I can deal with that and hopefully
get always something good out of it.
If it doesn't work out, try again.
Never give up.
[satisfied grunting]
-Bravo, Guenther.
-[in German] Salute the mountains!
-Thanks.
-Johannes, bravo.
[Johannes] Salute the mountains!
Bravo.
That's elixir of life!
[Steiner] This year, a lot of things
needed to be sorted,
but in the end, I think there's been
a lot of lessons learned over the year.
We are still here and we are building up
to be stronger next year.
How strong, I have no idea.
[chuckles]
{\an8}[Ricciardo] It's the toughest year
of my career.
{\an8}-The pressure's more on Daniel.
-[Brown] Ferrari's now ahead of us.
We need both drivers bringing home points.
-[Norris] Daniel's driving too slow.
-[Ricciardo] Agree to disagree.
[Brown] It'll be a fight to the finish.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>We lost four drivers.</i>
[Buxton] These are the races
where anything can happen.
[Lambiase] <i>You're leading the Grand Prix.</i>
[reporter] How would you describe
relations at the moment?
Fucking asshole!
[Horner] There is no relationship.
[tense music plays][Ricciardo] It's been
the toughest year of my career.
[commentator 1] <i>It's all going</i>
<i>horribly wrong for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>
[Ricciardo] <i>I'm struggling more and more.</i>
It has been tricky
to get up to grips with the car.
It's been a challenge
to change my driving style
to make this setup work.
I got hit.
Can't get first gear.
[groans]
In Formula 1, you can be the hero today,
but maybe the forgotten one tomorrow.
[tense music playing]
[Ricciardo] I'm not a good loser, at all.
{\an8}I get just filled with stress.
I'd be lying if I said otherwise.
-Hiya, brother.
-Long time no see.
{\an8}-[Ricciardo] Bring it in. Aah…
-Bring it in!
{\an8}-This feels good. This feels good.
-[Ricciardo] Hold it.
-[Hunter] Oh.
-Oh, that's good.
[Hunter] Go with it.
You're, like, real stiff.
Loosen up a little.
[Ricciardo] Fuck, man.
[Hunter] It's confidence.
Same with driving an F1 car.
[Ricciardo] I've put a lot of work in.
I think removing myself from it
will give me a bit of perspective now
and make me look forward to getting back.
-[Hunter] Yeah.
-Thanks, brother.
[Hunter] Anytime, mate. Anytime.
You can come to me for more
than when you need to bury a body.
-We can talk it out too.
-[Ricciardo laughs]
[Ricciardo] My career has gone full-on.
Deep down, I'm trying to find answers,
to find a way. That eats away at me.
[engine revving]
[edgy music playing]
[Brown] The first half of the season
hasn't gone our way.
{\an8}Ferrari's now ahead of us.
-[man 1] This is shit hot.
-[man 2] Good, hey, great.
[man 3] Hey, Zak. What's going on?
[Brown] Oh, fucking hell!
I get pretty angry
when something hasn't gone our way.
Daniel has clearly struggled
the first half of the season.
Daniel's a bit confused
as to why it's not clicked.
Yeah!
We're just waiting for it
to happen sooner rather than later.
Coming to the conclusion
I'm not young anymore.
-[man 4] This session's gotten younger.
-[Brown] Yeah.
[man 4] You finished last year
above Ferrari.
Is that the goal again, third this season?
We'll see. It's gonna be tough.
[Buxton] This season
has turned into a bit of a…
bit of a bad dream for Zak.
[Brown] All right. Here we go!
{\an8}[Buxton] Daniel has
to be pulling in the results
{\an8}if McLaren want third
in the Constructors'.
[Brown] If you panic as the leader,
then that sets in motion
other people panicking,
so I think you always
gotta look in control even if you're not.
[groans]
-[Brown] What do we have, ten left?
-[Seidl] Nine.
[Brown] Nine left. It's gonna get tight.
{\an8}[Seidl] Obviously now, going to Monza,
{\an8}important to have a… a clean weekend
and get back into the points to go.
[Brown] Hopefully, the summer break
came back with some…
[Seidl] Yeah.
[Brown] …energy and focus and we see
the, uh, the Daniel we signed up.
If McLaren are gonna land a punch
in the second half of the season,
they have to do it early,
so there's probably
no better place to do it
than Monza, home of Ferrari.
[tense music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>Welcome to Monza,</i>
<i>a wonderful place to be,</i>
<i>whether you're a Ferrari fan or not.</i>
[fans] Monza!
[Leclerc] Monza is crazy
whenever you are a Ferrari driver.
{\an8}The whole Italy
is counting on you to do well.
[cheering]
[Buxton] There's something magical
about Monza.
The history that echoes around the track,
the fans.
They always expect that there's a chance
of that sprinkling of magic dust
and a Ferrari win.
[commentator 1] <i>Charles Leclerc</i>
<i>wins in Monza!</i>
[Leclerc] Yes! Yeah, take that!
[in Italian] Good morning. Hi.
[in English] We are back to work
after the summer break,
with a key objective, beat McLaren
in the Constructors' Championship.
[Mattia in Italian]
We can't leave anything to faith.
We cannot commit mistakes.
{\an8}This weekend we think we have a good shot,
{\an8}both in quali and the race.
-[man in English] Are Ferrari that quick?
-[Brown] Yeah, they seem to be all right.
-It's gonna be close.
-[man] Shit.
[shutter clicking rapidly]
[photographer] Daniel!
[energetic music playing]
[trainer] Three, two.
Two, three. Three…
[Ricciardo] After the summer break,
I wanna feel like I'm competing again.
I'm gonna beat myself up
if we fall any further behind
than what we are.
[cheering]
[Ricciardo] If we could beat Ferrari here,
that might speak volumes.
[Brown] Monza's a big weekend for us.
We need both drivers to compete,
bringin' home as many points as possible.
[tense music playing]
[Mattia in Italian]
Ferrari doesn't race only to participate.
Ferrari races to always be better
and to win.
To win, you need a fast car.
I'd say our car is in tip-top shape.
We have the car
and we have the drivers.
[Buxton in English]
It's great times at Ferrari.
They've moved themselves
from a position of uncompetitiveness
to being on the same pace,
if not better than McLaren,
and with both drivers absolutely firing.
[trainer] Come on.
{\an8}My first Ferrari weekend in Monza,
{\an8}the target is to hit the ground running.
These last two races,
we've been on a run of points that
is very, very, very good, very consistent.
Honestly, I think Ferrari
just needs to keep doing what we're doing.
[shutter clicking]
[Seidl] What the mission is?
Make this work. [chuckles]
-[Ricciardo] Yeah.
-As quick as possible.
{\an8}A lot of people
congratulating us over winter
{\an8}for, uh, the great signing of Daniel.
Three, four, five months later on,
coming back, "Ah, I'm not sure
if that was the right signing."
"Maybe he's beyond his peak already."
We want to show to the world
that we signed the right guy.
[Norris] I think everyone expected Daniel
to have the upper hand on me this season.
{\an8}There was a lot of expectation
from the outside and from the fans,
{\an8}saying how, like, amazing
we were gonna be together
{\an8}'cause we're kind of
chilled, fun guys and so on,
{\an8}but I think we're very different.
People don't kind of realize that
as much as maybe what they do now.
-[Ricciardo] Want me there?
-[Sefton] Hello.
-[Ricciardo] Hi, you all right?
-[Sefton] Wherever you want.
Okey-dokey.
[Seidl] We had weekends before
where we thought we were strong.
It didn't work out.
We had it the other way around.
[Sefton] Lando should be paying
the Aperols for everyone after Belgium.
-[Norris] Why?
-[Sefton] You smashed the car up.
-[Norris] It's my first crash.
-[Ricciardo] At McLaren?
[Norris] In three years.
[Ricciardo] Wait.
Mugello, last year,
you crashed there, didn't you?
[Norris] Yeah, just front nose.
-[Ricciardo] Still a crash. Come on!
-[Sefton] That's a crash!
-[Norris] That's not a crash.
-[Ricciardo] Let's agree to disagree.
[Norris] That's not a crash. I spun.
[Ricciardo] You hit the tires, didn't you?
[Norris] The front wing.
Just tapped the wall.
-[Ricciardo] Oh, you did hit the wall?
-[Norris] Yeah.
[Seidl] Let's get through this weekend
without any crashes.
[Brown] It's critically important
that both drivers work well together.
The only way you're gonna have success
is having two drivers
as far up the field as possible.
[upbeat music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Here we go then.</i>
<i>qualifying action on a Friday evening.</i>
[Sainz] Ferrari is
the most successful Formula 1 team.
McLaren is the second most successful.
Ferrari is not in Formula 1
to finish third in the championship.
It's here to win.
[Brown] Discouraging thing is
I believe the competition's so tough,
you just have to be off a little bit
to be off.
Let's go, dude!
I'm fine when I'm in the office.
The nerves don't really kick in
until it's, uh, it's show time.
[commentator 3] <i>Here we go then.</i>
<i>All to play for.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Both Ferraris</i>
<i>out on track.</i>
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Adami] <i>Track is clear. You can push.</i>
-[Sainz] Copy.
[commentator 1] <i>Sainz got a bit of pace.</i>
{\an8}[Adami] <i>That was a good lap.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>Charles Leclerc really</i>
<i>didn't push the track limits at all.</i>
{\an8}[Leclerc] Is everything fine with the car?
<i>Something felt wrong.</i>
[Padros] I will come back to you.
[man 1 in Italian] Think something inside
got disconnected, under the wing.
-Don't think it can be anything else.
-[man 2] Disconnected?
[Adami in English] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>Box this lap. Box.</i>
[commentator 5] <i>The team say</i>
<i>there is a problem.</i>
<i>Hopefully, for Charles' sake,</i>
<i>on home ground, they can get it fixed.</i>
It's extremely difficult.
There's so much pressure on the team
just to try and take the best solution.
And you've got so little time.
We… we cannot relax.
[commentator 3] <i>Sainz comes</i>
<i>across the line now.</i>
{\an8}<i>Carlos Sainz goes seventh.</i>
<i>Not a great lap.</i>
[Sainz]<i> I did quite a big mistake.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Leclerc is coming straight out.</i>
{\an8}<i>We've heard about the issues</i>
<i>he's having from the cockpit.</i>
{\an8}<i>So I think he's gonna struggle.</i>
[Leclerc] It's so difficult to drive.
So difficult.
[commentator 3]
<i>Leclerc only goes eighth quickest.</i>
[Leclerc] Argh! It's a disaster. Fuck!
[commentator 3] <i>The McLarens</i>
<i>going out on the track now.</i>
{\an8}-[Stallard] <i>Okay, Daniel, so keep focused.</i>
-[Ricciardo] Okay.
[commentator 3] <i>Ricciardo goes fastest</i>
<i>in sector one.</i>
[Ricciardo] There's a few qualifyings
this year where it's been very, very close
with Lando normally
on the tail end of the closeness,
but it's really given me
a little more fire in the belly.
[commentator 1] <i>Ricciardo goes</i>
<i>fifth fastest for McLaren.</i>
[Stallard] Well done, Daniel.
{\an8}[Joseph] <i>Okay, Lando.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris</i>
<i>is setting a blistering pace.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>What can the McLaren driver do?</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Norris goes fourth fastest.</i>
[Brown] Fuck yeah!
[commentator 3]
<i>Norris ahead of his teammate</i>
<i>and both Ferraris.</i>
[Joseph] <i>P4.</i>
[Norris] Hey, hey, boy! Awesome.
Lando's confidence is
getting better and better,
his pace is unbelievable,
and I think
his first win is getting close.
Think it's just a matter of time.
[Stallard] Daniel, it's P5.
You're not gonna like this.
{\an8}<i>You're six milliseconds behind Lando.</i>
[Ricciardo] Okay. Yeah.
You're right. That sucks.
[Ricciardo groans]
[Norris] You wanna be best on the grid.
That includes your teammate.
That's the ambition,
always the mindset you gotta have.
I would say the pressure's
more on Daniel within the team.
[Sefton] So close!
[Ricciardo] The stopwatch doesn't lie.
I am slower.
It's just frustrating
to be that close but no cigar.
I'm fucking so angry.
[Seidl] Ah, it's okay.
[Ricciardo] I'm just, uh… angry.
I hate losing.
[fans sing] ♪ <i>Olé, olé, olé, olé ♪</i>
[fans cheering, yelling]
[Leclerc] It was
a tricky qualifying session.
I wish it had happened
somewhere else than in Monza.
[fans chant in Italian] Win for us!
-Leclerc win for us!
-[man] Thank you, Charles.
[in English] That motivates us even more.
[fans cheering]
[Ricciardo] I don't wanna
remain frustrated.
I don't wanna remain here
when I feel I should be here.
All right.
Peace. See you.
[in Italian] Look, your driver's dad is
already there ready for the ambush.
[Mattia] It's time to understand
the issue with the car.
There is less time to improve it
and less time to try.
But I know the team is strong.
The team knows how to react.
[Brown in English] All good?
[commentator 1] <i>Here at Monza,</i>
<i>it's the sprint race. Eighteen laps.</i>
<i>The higher they can finish in this race,</i>
<i>the higher they can start</i>
<i>in tomorrow's Grand Prix.</i>
[Buxton] The sprint race format
is being trialed at three races in 2021.
It's wheel-to-wheel racing
with drivers pushing to the absolute limit
to set their grid position
for the Grand Prix.
For the guys fighting
for the World Championship,
it's 18 laps of jeopardy.
But, conversely,
if you've got nothing to lose,
it's 18 potential chances
to have a better day on Sunday.
-[machinery whirring]
-["Staying Alive" playing over radio]
[Brown] Daniel, I don't believe,
feels qualifying
is necessarily his biggest strength,
so I think a sprint race
plays to his driving strengths.
[Ricciardo] This DJ
should get fucking shot.
You try to get into the zone,
and they take you right out of it.
Who thinks it's a good idea?
Like, who thinks this is a good idea?
[man] I don't… I don't run the playlist.

<i>Behind them will come the two Ferraris</i>

{\an8}[Sainz] Sorry for that.
-[Brown] That's what I'm talking about!
-[Stallard] That was nice.
-[Brown] That was good. Good drive.
-[Stallard] It was.
I think Ferrari
definitely feel the home pressure.
But, uh,
they've been doing this for a while,
so I think anyone who writes Ferrari off
is, uh, a little too new to Formula 1.
[Mattia] It has been a…
a difficult weekend.
Yesterday, problems we had in the quali,
so we know our weaknesses
and we are working on them.
Heads up, there is a lot to do,
but we know exactly what we need to do,
and I think that's the most important.
-[Ricciardo] Yeah.
-[Seidl] Front-row start.
-What was that?
-[Seidl] Front-row start.
-Good, huh? Thanks.
-[Seidl] Well done.
-Good start.
-[Ricciardo] Yeah. Happy. Cheers.
-You're not surprised though?
-[Seidl] No.
[Ricciardo] Good. Good.
-[reporter] Celebrate… [unclear]
-[Ricciardo laughs]
First front row since Mexico 2018.
And that was myself and Max
on that front row as well,
so familiar.
He was second, I was first.
He got me into turn one.
So… [clicks tongue]
…it… it's reverse now,
so I'll try and, uh…
give him some payback three years later.
[chuckles]
I'm gonna eat a fuck ton of pizza tonight.
That's for sure.
[indistinct chattering]
[in Italian] Thank you.
[in English] It was
a big turnaround for me
to be able to come out
and do that. It felt,
I don't know, right.
Like, that's maybe the best word.
It just felt right.
I'd kind of like that to then continue…
Bon appétit, everyone.
…into the race itself.
[tense music playing]
[reporter 1] Daniel, being as difficult
as it has been this season,
do you reckon this is that moment
that you finally got over that hurdle,
and from now on Daniel is back?
[Ricciardo] Yeah. You could say that.
Let's see after today,
but I'm… I'm confident
we can start to say that.
In front of the media pen and that,
I'll try and be "glass half full."
[reporter 2] Danny, is it a good day
for a shoey today?
But going through some
of the struggles this year
has been a little bit humbling
and deep down, like,
I'm putting the pressure on myself.
[Gow] This is
a huge opportunity for McLaren.
{\an8}It's been a long time
{\an8}since they've had both cars
starting at the front of the grid.
And this could be Daniel's chance
to prove to everybody
that he's still got what it takes.
[Brown] To compete against
these unbelievable teams
is not an easy feat.
I am nervous.
Not sure it's good for my heartbeat.
Formula 1's a pretty brutal environment.
Daniel struggled.
Some people thought maybe he was gone,
but I think
it's gonna be a fight to the finish.

on temperatures.
{\an8}[clunking]
[Ricciardo] I expect,
every lap, to come under attack.
But being the hunted is a powerful feeling
'cause you've got what they want.
When you've got more to fight for,
there is an additional shot of adrenaline.
I think there's nothing
more powerful than that.

{\an8}[Bono] <i>It's gonna be tight on exit</i>

[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton comes out</i>

<i>And there's Max Verstappen</i>
<i>into the first chicane.</i>
<i>It's wheel-to-wheel.</i>
[ominous music playing]
[shocked gasping]
[commentator 3] <i>Verstappen and Hamilton,</i>
<i>a very big accident.</i>
<i>Hope Hamilton's okay.</i>
[Max] That's what you get when you
don't leave the space. Fuckin' hell.
[commentator 2] <i>We've got a yellow flag.</i>
<i>That was a very, very near miss</i>
<i>for Lewis Hamilton.</i>
{\an8}[Stallard] <i>Hamilton and Verstappen crashed</i>
<i>and they are out of the race.</i>
[Ricciardo] Okay.
[commentator 3] <i>Safety car comes in.</i>
<i>Racing gets back underway.</i>
<i>Ricciardo leads.</i>
[Brown] Fuck yeah!
[commentator 3] <i>Leclerc right behind him</i>

{\an8}<i>Can Norris get past Leclerc?</i>
{\an8}<i>Goes to the inside.</i>
<i>Leclerc holds on.</i>
[Stallard] <i>We're gonna have our chance</i>

<i>Stay cool now. Stay cool.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Norris is gonna get</i>

[commentator 1] <i>Brilliant move</i>
<i>from Lando Norris.</i>
[all] Yeah!
[commentator 1]
<i>It's McLaren one-two at Monza.</i>
[man] Yes! Come on!
[commentator 3] <i>What a result this will be</i>
<i>if they can hold on until the end.</i>
[Norris] I need Daniel to pick up the pace
a bit. He's driving too slow.
-[Stallard] <i>Behind is Lando. He's quick.</i>
-[Ricciardo] Understood.
[Norris] You always wanna be
the better one of you and your teammate.
You wanna be the number one driver.
Do you think it's best for us
if I stay like this, stay where I am?
[commentator 3] <i>Norris is now trying</i>
<i>to fight with his teammate for the win.</i>
[Brown] Whoo! Fucking hell.
{\an8}[Joseph] <i>Lando, best for us where you are.</i>
<i>Hold position. Hold position.</i>
[Norris] You have to understand,
as a driver,
you have to do what you can
to also maximize the points for the team.
[Stallard] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>This is the last lap. Last lap.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
[commentator 3] <i>Daniel Ricciardo</i>
<i>is coming through the final corner.</i>
[cheering]
[commentator 1] <i>It's McLaren and Ricciardo</i>
<i>that win the Italian Grand Prix!</i>
[Ricciardo] Ha-ha-ha! Yeah!
P1!
We did it!
[Brown yells] Yeah!
[cheering]
[laughter, whooping]
[distant applause, whistling]
[Brown] Unbelievable!
[Ricciardo] Ha-ha! Come on!
[laughs] Yes!
Yeah, boy! [laughs ecstatically]
[yells triumphantly]
Yes! [whoops, sighs]
Deep down, I knew this was,
uh, this was gonna come,
so thanks for, uh, having my back.
<i>And for anyone who thought I left,</i>
<i>I never left.</i>
[crowd cheering, applauding]
[excited yelling]
[cheering]
[Ricciardo] That feeling
of crossing the line was just…
it was relief,
but it was, like, power, it was emotion.
[McLaren crew chanting]
{\an8}[Horner] It looked like the old Daniel.
{\an8}They're the kind of drives
that we've seen him do in our cars.
{\an8}You know, some… some fantastic drives.
{\an8}Everybody in the paddock
was pleased to see him win.
{\an8}The mental part of it
is very difficult to manage
{\an8}because everybody's different.
The best ones make it,
and obviously they can deal
with… with the stuff best.
-[cheering]
-[Ricciardo] Thanks, bro.
-[Max] Great drive.
-Thanks.
-[Max] Good start and you nailed it.
-Cheers.
I saw a lot of potential in McLaren
and they've always been an iconic team,
but I've been on the move,
obviously, the last couple years.
So this one, I certainly feel
like it's gonna… it's gonna stick.
-[Brown] How awesome was that?
-It's cool, huh?
[Brown] Yeah, a one-two.
-Felt like a long race.
-[Brown] Oh, it was the worst ever.
That was probably
the most exciting 53 laps I've ever had
in motor racing.
To be on the podium with both drivers,
it was just such an awesome result.
The win will do a tremendous amount
of confidence for Daniel.
[Sefton] Can you believe we got a one-two?
I couldn't actually believe it.
Like, winning is something,
and a one-two is like…
it's… it's actually stupid.
[Buxton] It had been so long
since they'd won a race.
To take that,
it shows they're… they're back.
And the proof of that
was that it was a one-two.
Both guys were there.
It's massive for the team.
[Ricciardo] Andreas!
Give us a smile. Give us a smile!
-[laughs]
-[Seidl giggles]
[Ricciardo] Ah. We'll, uh, we'll give him,
we'll give him a <i>Weissbier </i>later.
I was just happy
that we managed to pull it off as a team.
…two, one!
[all cheer]
Three, two, one!
[all cheer]
[all] Ooh…
[all cheer]
{\an8}[tattoo needle buzzing]
{\an8}[Brown] Oh God.
Oh, I don't wanna look.
I'm terrified of needles.
-[Ricciardo] How we doing?
-[artist] Almost done with the date.
-[Brown] That's just the date?!
-Yeah, then we gotta run the course.
[Brown groans]
Yeah.
[man] Yeah, he just had a lockup
into the first corner!
[Brown laughs]
People that say
you get addicted to tattoos, it ain't me.
[producer] Will you get another
if Lando wins?
Um… [chuckles]
You did a good job.
It definitely looks like Monza.
I think I'll stick with the one.
I'll get something else
to celebrate Lando's first win.
-[Riccardo] What a G.
-All your fault.
-[Ricciardo] What a G.
-[all laugh]
{\an8}Hey, Netflix.
{\an8}[Buxton] Williams were
a force to be reckoned with.
Now they are struggling to score a point.
I wanna be a world champion.
-Come on!
-[Urwin] Could be fireworks ahead.
[Jost] If we want to keep George.
we have to deliver.
[sobs, exhales shakily]
{\an8}[Buxton] Young drivers have to perform
immediately. It's sink or swim.
[thunder rumbles]
[brakes screech]
[Norris] The rain is falling
harder and harder.
[commentator 1] <i>That's Lando Norris.</i>
[Norris] Red flag, red flag, red flag.
[edgy music playing]<i>The news broke last Wednesday.</i>
{\an8}<i>Williams announced that, after 40 years</i>
<i>being owned by the family,</i>
{\an8}<i>they are being sold to some</i>
<i>venture capitalists called Dorilton,</i>
{\an8}<i>a US company.</i>
[reporter 2 on radio] <i>Claire Williams</i>
<i>stepped down as deputy team principal--</i>
[Claire] I've been driving to Williams
for 18 years of my life every day.
And, you know, it's not a job.
It's not a job.
Williams is my home.
This sport has changed enormously
in so many ways.
[rock music playing]
It is no longer
what it was when my dad started out.
You know, a bunch of guys that loved cars
and, you know, went racing.
They got their team together,
they pulled out the best car they could
at the start of the year
and they took it round the world.
[commentator] <i>Keke Rosberg</i>
<i>has won for Williams!</i>
[Claire] We've won 114 Grand Prix,
nine Constructors' Championships,
seven Drivers' Championships.
We've taken nearly 300 podiums
and we've made names out of so many
Formula 1 drivers around the world.
{\an8}Sir Frank Williams
created an incredible run of success.
{\an8}The second most successful team
in the history of Formula 1,
{\an8}behind only Ferrari.
But the financial realities
are what they are.
Big budgets from the factory teams
make it incredibly difficult to compete.
[Claire] Now it's big business.
You do well, you get more.
You do badly, you get less.
-[engine revving]
-[clunking]
[commentator 1] <i>Big crash.</i>
<i>That's the Williams out.</i>
[Russell] Car's all over the show.
We need to sort this out.
We really, really need to sort this out.
[Claire] "Should Sir Frank Williams
sack his daughter?"
It would be impossible for anybody
to live up to that kind of a history,
that kind of a reputation.
[Claire] You know, under my watch,
it started off great and didn't end well.
I think it was the right time
for me to step aside
and let someone else give it a go.
It's something that I, you know,
I'm… I'm okay with. I'm happy with.
[engine revving]
[birdsong]
Morning!
[edgy music playing]
{\an8}Is it okay like this all or…
{\an8}-[producer] You look great.
-[laughs]
-[Ogg] Morning.
-[Jost] Morning.
-[Ogg] Welcome. I can't hug you.
-[laughs]
[Ogg] How are you?
-[Jost] Good. And you?
-Good to finally have you here.
I'm Jost Capito, CEO of Williams Racing.
[Ogg] Um, do you want to come upstairs
and get a drink?
-Yeah.
-[Ogg] This is our conference center.
[Jost] When I got the call
about the position of CEO at Williams,
"We would love to have you on board
to… to change the team,
to get to the top again,"
that… it's something
that gives you goosebumps
when you… when you think about it.
And it's, "Okay,
that is the only challenge I would accept
within Formula 1 or within racing."
[Buxton] Jost Capito is perhaps best known
for his years
in the World Rally Championship.
Rallying will race on anything,
at any time, in any weather.
Formula 1 doesn't do that.
Yes, they're both
four-wheeled motorsports,
but they are completely different
forms of competition.
It's not gonna be easy for Jost coming in.
{\an8}That crazy, risk-taking,
rally driver spirit
{\an8}will be needed in abundance
{\an8}if Jost is going to move
the Williams team forward.
[Jost] I've got one story from rallying.
One of the drivers at rally
lost their confidence in the car
and I said to the co-driver,
"Squeeze his balls."
And he said, "What?!"
I said, "Squeeze his balls."
So I asked a couple of seconds later,
"Did you squeeze his balls?"
"Yes." I asked the driver,
"Did you feel your balls?"
He said, "Yes." "Okay, so now you know
you've got balls, go for it."
You have to distract them
from the issue they have.
I think that is
the confidence boost they need.
He's leading a team that's been
stagnating at the back for years,
so he'll need to raise morale
and expectations in everyone,
from the mechanics up to the drivers.
-[Jost] Morning, guys.
-[Russell] Jost. How you doing?
-[Jost] Good, George.
-[Russell] Yeah. [laughs]
[Russell] It's always a bit awkward when
you don't know how to introduce yourself.
-[Jost] I would love to hug you, but…
-[all laugh]
[producer] How would you
describe his character?
Very honest. Direct.
You know, no bullshit. [laughs]
Upbeat, motivational.
Um…
German.
-Fingers crossed we have a fast race car.
-[Jost] You'll get the best out of it.
[Russell] Well, I try.
I will do my best, as always.
How we doing? All right?
'Cause I had a bit of banter
about not being in the previous season
on my social media.
-I don't know if you saw.
-[producer] Yeah.
[Russell] Could I do something
like holding the…
[producer] No worries, mate. I mean,
technically, you were in it very briefly.
{\an8}-[chuckles] So you weren't--
-I was in it for a second, weren't I?
{\an8}I was on the phone to my missus.
-Brilliant.
-[producer laughs]
Season four.
Hopefully we make it in this year.
[Latifi] I have a really good
relationship with George.
I think that's important
between any driver pairing in F1.
{\an8}Because when you have
that kind of friendly dynamic as well
{\an8}outside of the track or the sessions,
I believe that kind of energy does
kinda radiate to… to the rest of the team.
[Russell] How we doing? Boys.
It's Williams's second season
with the same driver pairing,
but it may be their last.
An immediate problem for Jost
is George Russell.
His contract is up at the end of the year.
Rival teams are circling,
and there's lots of speculation
about where he might end up.
[suspenseful music playing]
[interviewer] It is your third year here,
uh, final year of the contract.
Who knows? I'm just going out there,
doing my job on the track.
What comes in the future will come.
My goal is to be in a…
in a championship-winning car
as soon as possible.
You know, I'd love more than anything
for that to be Williams.
That is where I want to be.
I want to be a world champion.
For now, we'll just focus on the job
here at Williams for this season
and, uh, trying to get the most out of it.
Great stuff. I know the focus
is very much Williams this season.
We want them right back where they were
in this era, which is at the front.
Williams were a force
to be reckoned with in Formula 1
and now they are struggling
to score a point.
Jost's job is revolution.
Nothing else will suffice.
He has to completely
turn that team upside down.
[Jost] At Williams,
it… it needs a cultural change.
We have to see
how we improve our processes.
We are really aiming
for having the fastest pit stops
and everything that we can influence
to be the best.
The new owners want to get Williams back
winning races and championships again.
[applause, whistling]
[host] <i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>Please welcome onstage</i>
<i>Jost Capito!</i>
-[applause]
-So, good evening, everybody.
I think we are in Austin, we are in Texas,
and it has to be like this!
[whistling, scattered whooping]
{\an8}[Jost] At Williams Racing,
we have a fantastic board
{\an8}with Matthew, Darren, and James.
{\an8}Please get up, and thank you
so, so much for all your trust.
[whistling, whooping]
[Buxton] Williams have been bought by
an investment firm named Dorilton Capital
who will want to see results,
both on the track and in the boardroom.
Ultimately, the responsibility of that
will fall to Jost.
The decisions that he makes,
the direction that he takes the team in,
i-it's all down to him.
-[applause]
-[Jost] Thank you so much.
-It was really cool. Really cool.
-Have fun.
[Jost] It looked great, yeah.
Dorilton Capital, our owners,
want to be successful on the racetrack
and create a brand
that is successful beyond racing.
So the expectations of the owners
is very high.
[camera shutters clicking]
[Buxton] Ultimately in Formula 1,
the Drivers' Championship doesn't matter.
It's the Constructors' Championship
that pays out at the end of the season,
and every position you climb
in that Constructors' Championship
sees tens of millions of dollars
more money.
That is what the team needs to see.
[playful dance music playing]
[Russell] Got the Williams crew
walking in all together, eh?
-[Pérez] Too many cameras.
-[man] Are you famous or something?
[shutter clicking]
[Ricciardo] Hey, Netflix.
[Steiner] No, we are slow walking.
He said "No, we're faster on the track."
"Don't worry, I know that."
"I didn't say on the track.
You are slow as a person."
[commentator 2] <i>No points</i>
<i>in the opening three races for Williams,</i>
<i>so Jost Capito will be hoping</i>
<i>they can make headway</i>
<i>in round four at the Spanish Grand Prix.</i>
[shutters clicking]
[Jost] Morning!
Coming in this year
and being tenth in the championship,
that means being tenth in the paddock.
I have to walk past every other team,
and it is a long way.
Through the whole paddock,
every morning, every night.
I hate this walk of shame.
[Russell] The winners get to have
the shortest walk into the paddock.
The losers are at the back.
Williams is right at the end
of the paddock, because we finished last.
That is one walk of shame, for sure.
[Jost] It's physically painful to pass
all the teams that are ahead of you.
Morning, guys.
I told the team
they have always to do the whole walk
and, uh, stop at the point
where they want to be next year.
Every single time
you walk through the paddock,
it gives you the pure reality check
where you are.
And then you have to think
why you are there
and what do you do to move to the front.
We have to move forward this year.
It's taking more bold moves with the car,
but also taking
more bold moves on the strategy.
Jost's job is huge.
The car is one that the team
doesn't expect to be competitive.
They have a driver, George Russell,
who's got one foot out the door.
It's not gonna be an easy time for him.
[Jost] Morning, everybody.
Last race, I couldn't be there,
but we had a really good qualifying.
It was fantastic to be that close to Q3.
Absolutely outstanding.
And then, on Sunday,
for me it was quite painful,
and I think it was for all of you as well,
so let's see what we can do this weekend,
and, uh, let's go…
-[all] Racing!
-[Jost] Okay, guys.
-[crew member] Thank you.
-You're welcome.
[tense music playing]
[machinery whirring]
[engine revving]
[Jost] I want to get Williams
back up the grid,
so you need to have
good results in qualifying.
If we do this
and take some risk in the strategies,
then, in the race, the points will come.
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>Let's check in</i>
<i>with Latifi. He's going for it.</i>
-[Latifi] My left side mirror is cracked.
-[Jego] <i>Okay. Keep the pace.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>A 1:20</i>
<i>for Nicholas Latifi.</i>
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>we're gonna see much faster lap times.</i>
[Latifi] That's all there is.
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>
{\an8}[Russell] Can you give me
some advice on the pace?
[Urwin] We've got about 0.3 to find
in sector one and similar in sector two.
[Russell] Copy.
[commentator 2] <i>Russell goes</i>
<i>onto his flying lap now</i>
<i>to see whether he can possibly</i>
<i>squeeze that Williams into the top ten.</i>
[Urwin] <i>Let's just keep the pace up.</i>
[Russell] Just keep an eye
on the, uh, brakes obviously.
[Urwin] <i>A-firm.</i>
[Russell] The car is a harder to drive.
I lost a lot of speed on the straight.
[commentator 2] <i>It's not</i>
<i>a good middle sector for Russell.</i>
[Russell] Advise on brakes.
-[Urwin] The material is coming off.
-[Russell] I feel like I'm losing them!
[commentator 1] <i>So Russell</i>
<i>round the final corner and he's not happy.</i>
[decreasing engine revving]
[Russell] I obviously lost a lot of time
in the last corner. Couldn't do any more.
[commentator 3] <i>That's Russell, 15th,</i>
<i>and Latifi, 19th on the grid</i>
<i>on a disappointing day</i>
<i>for the Williams team.</i>
[Russell] The car was…
It was incredibly slow,
difficult to drive.
It induced mistakes into my driving,
it made me lose confidence,
and it was just difficult.
[machinery whirring]
-[Russell] The car--
-[Jost] What is with the brakes now?
The brakes are still very, very difficult.
I think they're just worried for tomorrow.
[Jost] I think it's…
To get… To get it now changing
and go into qualifying with brakes
you've never driven, for me, is not right.
[Russell] No, for sure.
[Jost] As a CEO or team principal,
you have to take tough decisions
for the benefit of the team,
and this is not always easy,
but they are needed.
[Buxton] Jost comes across
as very kinda, like, cuddly, really nice,
but, uh, there is a very serious operator
that exists, uh, underneath that.
[Jost] I went out of the garage
with George.
And George said
he's not happy with the brakes.
Uh, Nicky complained a lot
about the brakes.
He says he has no confidence in turn one.
He doesn't know what the brakes will do,
if they would brake.
He gets on the brake,
he has no deceleration at all.
You don't achieve the levels of success
that he has in motorsport
without knowing,
not just the decisions to make,
but having the fortitude
to take them when you have to.
[Jost] We have
to get the mechanics talking.
Because they don't
tell you anything right now.
And then we sort it out step by step.
I don't want to start
next year's season like this.
Yeah? Okay.
I think we need the full review. You co…
I can't work like this, I tell you.
Yeah? Thanks.
[upbeat music playing]
[Russell] Jost,
he's not messing around. [chuckles]
[man] No messing around.
[Russell] I think, um…
I think there's gonna be some people
on their way out shortly
who have been there… for a little while.
It's needed, isn't it?
These people need a kick up the arse.
If you're, yeah, finishing last
for the last four years in a row.
[Jost] For me,
the most exciting thing of Formula 1
is it's all about racing and performance.
When the flag drops, the bullshit stops.
[commentator 1] <i>Here we go,</i>
<i>for the second Sunday in a row.</i>
<i>It is race day here in Barcelona.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>After yesterday's</i>
<i>qualifying performance,</i>
<i>Williams are going to have to pull</i>
<i>something spectacular out of the bag</i>
<i>to have an impact on this race.</i>
[Buxton] It's just been
such a difficult season for Williams.
Jost is desperate
to see the team score points.
And points would obviously
please the investors.
One point can move you up one place,
which can bring you
tens of millions of dollars more
in prize money at the end of the season.
[Russell] Jost is a racer.
He recognizes the position we're in.
We don't have the pace. The car is slow.
And if we play the percentages,
we'll come away with nothing.
If I finish 11th or 12th or 13th or 14th,
you don't get points for that.
You get points for P10 and above.
And that's why you're willing
to roll the dice.
[Jost] If the situation comes up
that you can benefit from something,
we, as a team, have to be there to get it.
If we do bold decisions and they work out,
we might get in the points.
If we see an opportunity coming up,
we have to take it.
[engines revving]
[Urwin] Okay, George.
Consider early overtake.
[commentator 1] <i>Here comes the Williams</i>
<i>of George Russell,</i>
<i>uh, trying to make a move</i>
<i>on Mick Schumacher.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Super move.</i>
[Urwin] Right, let's crack on. Well done.
{\an8}[Jego] <i>Okay, Nicky, you're P16.</i>
<i>Gap to ahead, three seconds.</i>
{\an8}[Latifi] Copy.
[commentator 1] <i>"Engine stopped,"</i>
<i>says Yuki Tsunoda.</i>
-[Jego] Safety car.
-[Latifi] Safety car, safety car!
[commentator 1] <i>Who's gonna benefit</i>
<i>from this safety car?</i>
[Jost] We have
the ninth fastest car this season.
It's only if we take
a different risk than others
we will finally get points.
-[Urwin] That tire's ready to go.
-[Jost] Ready to go?
[Urwin] Okay, George, we'll box this lap.
{\an8}[Russell] Yeah, understood.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Down at Williams,</i>
{\an8}<i>it looks like George Russell</i>
<i>is making his way into his pit box.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Jost Capito's team</i>
<i>are rolling the dice here.</i>
<i>They're going for new tires</i>
<i>whilst the safety car is out</i>
<i>and the others are unable to race.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>A strategic gamble or what?</i>
[machinery whirring]
[commentator 2]
<i>That's their only pit stop done.</i>
<i>Very early, though, in the Grand Prix</i>
<i>to have changed their tires already.</i>
[Urwin] We are going to the end
on this tire. Make sure you look after it.
We need some tires at the end.
[commentator 1] <i>They might be</i>
<i>a couple of laps shy.</i>
<i>How long will they last?</i>
{\an8}[Jego] <i>Pace is good.</i>
<i>You're doing a good job.</i>
{\an8}Gap 2.7 to George. 2.7.
[commentator 4] <i>Look at George Russell.</i>
<i>Up two places now. Tremendous.</i>
[Urwin] Okay, George,
currently P10. Currently P10.
{\an8}<i>This is looking really good for us.</i>
<i>Let's keep it up. Looking really good.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Thirteen laps to go.</i>
<i>Russell is closing in on Alonso for ninth.</i>
[Urwin] <i>Okay, George, give us</i>
<i>a tire update if you can. Tire feedback.</i>
[Russell] Tires are pretty shot.
[tense music playing]
[Urwin] Okay, George,
keep pushing. Keep pushing.
[Russell] I cannot get
any closer than this.
[Urwin] Okay, there could be
some fireworks ahead, George.
Three laps to go, three laps to go.
Let's keep pushing.
[Russell] Uh, tires are gone, guys.
[Urwin] <i>Go defend. Go defend.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>That's Norris into tenth</i>
<i>and the Williams out of the points.</i>
[tense music playing]
[Urwin] Okay, George,
that's the flag, so go in lap.
[Russell] Sorry. Gave everything.
I was pushing like hell to do that.
[commentator 3] <i>Russell, in the end,</i>
<i>is 14th. Latifi is 16th.</i>
<i>Williams took a gamble today</i>
<i>and it didn't quite pay off.</i>
{\an8}[Jego] <i>That was a good race, mate.</i>
{\an8}[Latifi] I don't know. Still it's just…
lack of pace overall, it seems.
[Russell] It's frustrating when you feel
you've done everything you could
with cars around you
who are much faster than you.
You know, you're the one
driving the car and… [sighs]
…ultimately, people feel you're the one
who can make the difference,
but, you know,
we're punching well above our weight.
You know, of course
the… the team feels a bit beaten up.
It… If you don't have any success
and you start the season from
the previous season having zero points,
the morale, for sure, is not good.
If we do new things, take new approaches,
we can beat the others.
If we have the pride
and the belief that we can do better,
then we will do better,
I'm absolutely convinced.
If we do the same as everybody does,
we will always be not in the points.
I really push the team, and say,
"Take some different strategies."
Good luck.
[commentator 2]
<i>Williams rolling the dice again.</i>
<i>Just one pit stop for them.</i>
<i>Most of the field doing two.</i>
{\an8}[Jego] <i>That's P18.</i>
{\an8}-[Latifi] There's nothing from the tires.
<i>-</i>[Jego] <i>Understood, Nicky.</i>
<i>Probably a lot to learn.</i>
[Jost] We'll get there.
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome along</i>
<i>to qualifying.</i>
<i>Let's see what they can do.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Russell out</i>
<i>of the final corner.</i>
<i>And it's ninth on the grid!</i>
[Russell] That's fucking awesome!
Nice one.
[commentator 2] <i>Cheers and celebrations</i>
<i>in the Williams garage.</i>
[Jost] You know it's the first time Q3
for Williams since Monza '18.
Tell me about tomorrow, please.
-Points has to be the minimum. Has to be.
-[chuckles]
[commentator 3] <i>Lap 64 of 71.</i>
<i>Closing stages of the Austrian Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Russell still hanging on ahead of Alonso.</i>
<i>That one-stop gamble paying off</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>
[Jost] We have to try to push.
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Alonso's got the chance.</i>
{\an8}<i>His best chance of the race.</i>
<i>And he's into tenth place.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>And Williams' wait</i>
<i>for points continues.</i>
You know, it was a really tricky race.
Yeah, I did everything I could, but…
We're getting closer, that's for sure.
P12 in France, P11 here.
Yeah, soon. Soon.
[Jost] Winning is everything.
That doesn't mean that you have to be
in the team that always wins.
But we want to be closer.
So we want to… to close the gap
to the teams
that are running in front of us.
It's not easy,
but I want to do it for Williams.
We will do everything possible
to close that gap.
[commentator 3] <i>Welcome</i>
<i>to beautiful Budapest.</i>
<i>The rain has arrived for round 11</i>
<i>of the Formula 1 World Championship.</i>
[Toto] Morning.
[man] Nice.
Just that little bit
of controlled aggression. Great work.
[Vettel] I have been mistaken for Daniel.
"Ah, you are that guy. I know you.
Ah, you are Daniel Ricciardo." I was like,
"How did you know?" [chuckles]
[Russell] Not filming me
getting changed, are you?
Bit Valtteri Bottas this,
with my arse out, isn't it?
[edgy music playing]
[Sine in French] I hope
the weather will get better.
[commentator 3 in English] <i>Weather looks</i>
<i>as miserable as the mood in some garages.</i>
<i>For newly-owned Williams,</i>
<i>they are staring down the barrel</i>
<i>of a second year without points in a row,</i>
<i>unless they can achieve something</i>
<i>on a mixed-up day like today.</i>
[Jost] Uh… We worked so hard
for the first half of the season,
and it was not always easy
for hard work and for disappointment,
but if we continue doing this,
I'm sure there will be some points
lying somewhere that we can grab.
[Buxton] At Williams,
it's not the season that anybody wanted.
But to be sat with, you know,
zero points heading to the summer break,
it's… ah, it's got to be soul-crushing.
[Jost] It's so difficult.
Dorilton, they feel
exactly like the team feels.
[man 1] We need strong work ethic.
{\an8}We do need a team leader who's very good
at, um, at interacting with engineers,
{\an8}working with them,
{\an8}and putting the time in
and really moving that car forwards,
{\an8}because it is gonna be difficult.
-[man 2] We have to make a move ourselves.
-[James] Yeah.
{\an8}I would love to understand
what your thinking is, uh, at this time.
[Jost] We still have
quite a long way to go to the top
and our long-term objectives is we want
to win races and win championships,
so I think we should talk about drivers.
George's three years are over
at the end of the season.
This year, for us, he is excellent.
I believe we need a driver
who can lead the team into the next step.
We have to look
at what we can do to keep him.
If opportunity comes up,
we have to be there to take it.
If we want to keep George,
we have to deliver.
We have to get points.
[anticipatory music playing]
[Russell] Looks pretty gray out there.
{\an8}[Latifi] Guys,
if I could still have the fan?
{\an8}Even though it's raining.
Fucking toasting in here already.
[Buxton] They say that rain
is the great equalizer in Formula 1.
{\an8}[Steiner] Rain in a race situation
is unpredictable.
{\an8}You cannot predict it, you know.
It just needs to come your way.
[Jost] If you are on the back of the grid,
sometimes it is the only chance
to get points.
[commentator 3] <i>Two years since Williams</i>
<i>last scored a point then,</i>
<i>and that wait continues.</i>
<i>Jost Capito coming</i>
<i>under increased pressure.</i>
<i>Can the team</i>
<i>use the rain to their advantage?</i>
[commentator 2] <i>With the rain,</i>
<i>this is an opportunity for teams like</i>
<i>Williams to score a big haul of points</i>
<i>if they take the right gamble</i>
<i>at the right time.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>It's lights out</i>
<i>and away we go.</i>
<i>Verstappen's been hit!</i>
[loud groaning]
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>The Aston Martin</i>
<i>into the Ferrari.</i>
{\an8}[Leclerc] Ah! They fucked me!
[groaning]
[commentator 3] <i>Absolute chaos</i>
<i>at the first corner.</i>
[Stroll] Oh, I just completely locked up.
[thumping]
{\an8}[Pérez] What an idiot!
{\an8}[Leclerc] They didn't stop!
{\an8}-They fucking went into me.
<i>-</i>[Padros] <i>Yeah.</i>
[Norris] What the fuck happened?
[Stroll] I'm so sorry.
[commentator 2] <i>That crash</i>
<i>has taken out five drivers.</i>
<i>Somehow, the Williams cars</i>
<i>have avoided all damage.</i>
<i>and Latifi and Russell</i>
<i>find themselves in the top ten.</i>
{\an8}[Jego] <i>So, bit of an update.</i>
{\an8}<i>You're currently P6. Russell P8.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Nicholas Latifi is</i>
<i>as high as he's been</i>
<i>at any time in any race in Formula 1.</i>
{\an8}<i>George Russell is now eighth.</i>
{\an8}<i>He surely, eventually,</i>
<i>will get a points finish for Williams.</i>
[Urwin] <i>Okay, George. Go race.</i>
[dramatic music playing]
[Russell] If you need to compromise
my race to help Nicky, do it.
I will box early to avoid the undercut
from anyone else.
Prioritize Nicky.
[commentator 1] <i>Fair play, George Russell.</i>
<i>'Cause he can see</i>
<i>what this scenario means to Williams.</i>
-[Ogg] I actually feel sick.
-[man] Yeah, I feel sick as well! [laughs]
{\an8}[Jego] <i>Okay, Nicky, 43 laps to go.</i>
<i>You are doing great.</i>
{\an8}<i>Maybe there'll be quicker cars around,</i>
<i>but we're in a good position.</i>
<i>-Keep doing what you're doing.</i>
-[Latifi] Copy.
{\an8}[Urwin] <i>George, you're currently P10.</i>
<i>All the cars ahead have already pitted.</i>
<i>So if we can't get past Schumacher,</i>
<i>we've got 38 laps</i>
<i>to manage and protect from Ricciardo.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>How many times</i>
<i>have Williams been here before?</i>
<i>Russell needs to move up the field</i>
<i>or risk missing out on points yet again.</i>
-[Russell] I can overtake, it's fine.
<i>-</i>[Urwin] <i>Roger.</i>
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>Here comes Russell</i>
<i>to the outside of Schumacher at turn two.</i>
<i>Russell goes right round the outside.</i>
<i>Brilliant move!</i>
<i>And he's now up into ninth spot.</i>
<i>-</i>[Urwin] <i>Nice work.</i>
-[Russell] Yes! I'm happy.
[Ogg] All right?
[man] Getting goosebumps.
{\an8}[Jego] <i>Okay, Nicky,</i>
<i>we're still racing for P8,</i>
<i>so now the target is to go to the end.</i>
[Latifi] Let me know
if I need to up the pace.
[Jego] <i>Keep pushing. Flat out. Flat out.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>This means everything</i>
<i>to the Williams team.</i>
<i>They're only a few laps away</i>
<i>from their first points in two years.</i>
{\an8}[Urwin] <i>Verstappen, next car back now.</i>
<i>Three seconds.</i>
<i>Let's start to pick up the pace.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
[Urwin] <i>Verstappen, 2.3 behind.</i>
[Jego] Keep pushing. Critical.
[man 1] Come on!
[man 2] Come on, baby!
[Urwin] Gap at 1.3.
{\an8}-[Latifi] Is this the last lap?
<i>-</i>[Jego] <i>This is the last lap.</i>
{\an8}[Urwin] <i>There will be one more lap.</i>
Come on!
[Latifi] Yeah, I'm losing the tires a bit.
[Ogg] Come on. Come on. Come on.
[Urwin] <i>Gap at 1.0.</i>
<i>Go defend now. Said go defend.</i>
[Jost] Come on! Come on!
[Jego] <i>Overtake press,</i>
<i>exit of last corner.</i>
[raucous cheering]
[delighted squealing]
[commentator 2] <i>Latifi in eighth</i>
<i>and George Russell in ninth.</i>
[Jost] <i>Nicky, congratulations!</i>
[Jego] <i>Congrats, Nicky.</i>
<i>Great job, that's P8. Amazing!</i>
[Latifi] Yep, good job, guys.
[man] We fucking did it!!
[Jost] Fantastic job. Well done.
[indistinct chattering]
-[Russell] Ah! Come on! Yes, guys.
-[Urwin] <i>P9, mate, P9.</i>
<i>That's two and a half years</i>
<i>of graft right there.</i>
[Russell] Bloody deserve that.
We deserve that.
-[applause]
-[man] Well done, George!
[commentator 1] <i>That's six points</i>
<i>for the Williams team.</i>
<i>That is so necessary for them.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>It moves them up</i>
<i>into eighth in the championship,</i>
<i>which could have</i>
<i>huge financial implications</i>
<i>come the end of the season.</i>
[Latifi] The past years have been
hugely difficult for the team.
When Jost came in,
the kinda team had some new life,
so there's kind of naturally this
positive uplift in, uh…
in morale and atmosphere.
So coming so, so close to points
on a few occasions,
then to kinda get
that double points finish for the team
was so, so special, yeah.
-[Jost] You see!
-[Ogg laughs]
-Uh, it was about time!
-[Jost] Ah!
-My heart--
-[Jost] The right time though.
-[Ogg] Yeah.
-Perfect timing.
[Ogg] Best way to do it as well
with both of them.
-[applause continues]
-[Jost chuckles]
Yeah, that was fantastic.
Fantastic, uh, feeling.
Fantastic!
It was such a relief for everybody.
Only if the team believes we are capable
of getting points, we will get points.
If there was not a belief in the team
we would not have got the points,
I'm absolutely convinced.
[Russell] Ah…
You know, three years of…
of really hard work,
difficult moments.
Rea… Really difficult moments.
[breathes heavily, voice catches]
I'm quite emotional actually.
[chuckles awkwardly]
-[reporter 1] I can see from outside.
-[Russell] Yeah.
[reporter 2] George! Has to be
an amazing feeling, yeah?
Yeah. [chuckles emotionally]
Fuck. P9. That is like…
[reporter 2] P9.
[exhales sharply]
It's been such a, like, long road
for us, you know?
[mumbles incoherently, sighs]
-Yeah, fuck.
-[reporter 2 laughs]
-[chuckles] That's enough.
-[reporter 2] Best interview ever!
[Russell] I saw the sweat and tears
where the whole team got zero reward
for all the time away.
Away from family, away from friends.
Hard work, dedication.
And finally, we achieved
something pretty special on that day.
Guys, can we get everyone in quickly?
Before it rains as well.
{\an8}For Williams, the glory days aren't
as easy to come by as they once were.
[cheering]
[Buxton] The legacy of Williams
is so incredibly strong,
but the motivation exists today.
That's Jost Capito.
Scoring some points, each little win
is the next piece of motivation
to take the team back to better times.
Perhaps what Williams needed
was a break from the past
in order to cement a strong future.
[photographer] Ready, everyone?
One, two, three!
[all cheer]
[Russell] I would've loved for this
to have been my first season at Williams,
because you really feel like the team
is heading in a great direction.
We've got Jost at the helm,
who is 120% focused on performance.
Whereas, previously,
for… for other reasons,
it was focused on survival.
It would be a shame to leave
and not be part of any future success.
I've got two options,
I think, for next year.
Whatever happens,
the Williams name will…
will live on for sure.
{\an8}Young drivers have to perform immediately.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Esteban Ocon in P14.</i>
[Ocon] Fucking hell.
[Tsunoda] The pressure is huge.
-I can't fucking believe this car!
-[Horner] He has to deliver.
[Ocon] The opportunity can be gone
in a second.
[Tsunoda] Fuck! Sorry!
{\an8}[Horner] You all right?
{\an8}Max is feeling really unwell,
{\an8}and it's a big concern.
[commentator 2] <i>One race</i>
<i>to decide the championship.</i>
<i>-</i>[tires screech]
-[groaning]
[Horner] It's now or never.
[dramatic music playing][horn honking]
[cheering, whistling]
[Buxton] They say Formula 1
isn't a finishing school.
Young drivers have to perform immediately.
It's sink or swim.
[Tsunoda] Formula 1 is what I was
dreaming for from four years old.
The amount of pressure is huge.
You have to perform well always.
[engine revving]
There are thousands of drivers
that would love to be in our position.
-[tires screeching]
-[crowd cheering]
[Ocon] The opportunity
can be gone in a second.
[high-pitched whistling]
[engineer 1] <i>We've got significant damage.</i>
[Leclerc] Fuck! Shit!
[commentator 1] <i>It's a nightmare!</i>
[Norris] What the fuck happened?
[engineer 2] <i>Flat out. Flat out.</i>
[Peckett] <i>You are leading the Grand Prix.</i>
-[machinery whirring]
-[crowd cheering]
-[edgy music playing]
-[car alarm beeps]
[engine starts]
My name is Yuki Tsunoda.
I came from Japan,
racing with Scuderia AlphaTauri.
{\an8}-Is that okay? [laughs]
-[producer] Nice. Like it.
{\an8}Yuki's a little pocket rocket.
His ascent to Formula 1
is nothing short of incredible.
In the last four years,
he's gone from his competitive debut
to racing in Formula 1.
{\an8}Tsunoda is an exciting talent,
{\an8}probably the best driver to come out
of Japan for at least a decade,
{\an8}if not more.
[commentator 2] <i>All of Japan</i>
<i>is watching this, the new star,</i>
<i>Yuki Tsunoda.</i>
Being in Formula 1, dream come true.
I always try to improve my driving.
Even outside of racing,
you still can practice your skills
on lots of roundabouts.
Nice!
Hopefully, the future is
the world champion.
[Buxton] Yuki Tsunoda's racing
for AlphaTauri,
which is Red Bull Racing's sister team.
Just as with all Red Bull juniors,
he's been living
in Milton Keynes in the UK.
[upbeat music playing]
[Lawson] Look at your room.
{\an8}His room's this messy,
but he won't let me walk in with shoes on.
-Is this all dirty?
-[Tsunoda] It's a bit dirty.
[Lawson] A bit dirty?
It's dirty or not dirty.
Dude! When was the last time
you put the washing on?
-[Tsunoda laughs]
-Come on!
[Buxton] As a kid,
moving thousands of miles away from home,
it must be a culture shock.
Not even people who live in Milton Keynes
want to live in Milton Keynes!
[Tsunoda] Um…
Most…
most boring place in the world, I'd say.
Yeah.
Hello.
[server] So, I have
your chicken and mushroom pie.
-[man] Thank you very much.
-[Tsunoda] Thank you.
I really miss the Japanese food.
[man] Look at that.
[Tsunoda] Yeah, have to a little bit adapt
to the UK.
-First time. Never eaten fish and chips.
-[man] Never?
[Tsunoda] That makes fat, no?
Fish and chips.
{\an8}I wouldn't have it every day
as a… as a key meal.
[Tsunoda] What is this?
[Carroll] This is mushy peas.
It's delicious.
-Good.
-[Carroll laughs]
[upbeat music playing]
[shutter clicking]
[photographer] Super. Doing a good job.
[Tost] This year, we have
a very strong driver lineup.
{\an8}With Yuki Tsunoda, we have a young rookie
{\an8}who has a lot of potential.
With Pierre Gasly,
we have an experienced driver.
{\an8}I'm pretty sure we can have
a strong working relationship
within the team to…
to push this team forward.
[woman 1] So 2,000 people
have written asking for your autograph.
-You and Pierre. Yeah.
-[Tsunoda] Really?
-[Tsunoda] Which is, uh… more?
-[laughing] I don't know!
You're so competitive!
-Are people requesting me or him?
-[woman 1] Obviously you.
[Tsunoda] I'm a really competitive guy.
But also I… I want to have some fun.
-I did a big fart. I thought you…
-[Gasly laughs]
[Gasly] Yuki doesn't have any filters.
The stuff he says comes out
from his mouth straightaway.
-Are you gonna take a porn video?
-[woman 2] Stop it!
He's an interesting character.
A good, uh, entertainer.
[laughter, impressed exclamations]
-[Tsunoda] That's good.
-[man] That's not bad.
I always say to drivers
to come into Formula 1 is one story.
To stay in Formula 1
is a completely other story.
So Yuki needs to now work really hard
to achieve this goal.
[producer] What do you need
from Yuki this year?
Put… Push the right-hand pedal.
That's it. Just be as fast as possible.
Nothing more, nothing less.
[tense music playing]
{\an8}[commentator in French] <i>Hello.</i>
<i>Very happy to be welcoming you…</i>
{\an8}[commentator 1 in English] <i>Welcome.</i>
{\an8}<i>We are in the south of France</i>
<i>for the 61st French Grand Prix.</i>
-[Tost] Yuki.
-[Tsunoda] Morning.
-[Tost] What's with the haircut?
-[giggles]
-Getting long, eh?
-[Tost] Yeah.
[Lewis whistles] Come here.
[Steiner] No, you cannot swear now.
[engineer] I cannot swear now?
-No. You're not allowed because--
-[engineer] Oh fuck! Oh fuck!
I wear what they give me.
-[man] You look like Nico Rosberg.
-Yeah! [laughs]
-I don't know how to take that!
-[laughter]
[Buxton] AlphaTauri have
a real opportunity this year
to perform at a level
that they never have.
[Tost] The goal is quite clear, defined.
We want to be on the fifth position
in the Constructors' Championship.
It would be the best result
in the history of AlphaTauri.
The midfield is very tight
and our main competitor is Alpine.
[upbeat music playing]
[engine revving]
[in French] Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
[in English] Being French in, uh…
in the French Grand Prix…
[in French] Hello. How are you? Thanks.
[in English] It's something special.
It makes me proud.
{\an8}I mean,
to have the French flag on the car,
uh, to have the Eiffel Tower on my helmet…
-[in French] You make us dream, so…
-Thank you.
…it can't get better than that.
-[in French] Future champion.
-That is kind.
[in English] This year, for me,
scoring consistently every race,
that's what I want to achieve
-[in French] My heart is beating fast.
-Really?
[in English] I've learned
that, uh, if you perform,
there will be always
plenty of opportunities and…
[girl] Thank you.
…if you start not performing
the way people want, uh,
obviously it becomes more tricky.
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>Here comes Esteban Ocon</i>
<i>in the Force India.</i>
{\an8}[Gow] When Esteban Ocon
arrived in Formula 1,
{\an8}he quickly got the reputation
of being a bit of a hothead.
[commentator 3] <i>Two Force Indias together.</i>
<i>They're going wheel to wheel!</i>
[Ocon] What the fuck?!
<i>Fucking shit, man. Fucking shit.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Oh, Verstappen's off!</i>
[Max] What a fucking idiot.
[Buxton] At the end of 2018,
Esteban found himself without a seat.
He was left on the sidelines for a year.
But there was salvation
in the form of Renault.
I do believe that Esteban can help us
in making the top three.
[Buxton] Cyril Abiteboul saw
the potential in Esteban.
[Cyril] Super, Esteban, bravo.
[Ocon] Woohoo!
Cyril is a very important person
in my career.
He has been the one
that got me back to Formula 1.
But all of a sudden, Cyril's gone.
-That's it?
-[producer laughs]
{\an8}[tense music playing]
[Buxton] For 2021,
Renault have rebranded Alpine.
And there's a new boss in charge.
{\an8}Ah… There we go.
-[producer] Welcome.
-Thank you.
I'm Laurent Rossi, CEO of Alpine.
[producer] The last team principal
was Cyril.
-Yeah.
-He's no longer with us.
Talk to me about that.
{\an8}Well, I cannot really comment on that
{\an8}'cause I'm… I'm… I've arrived
after all of the events,
{\an8}so, uh, now we… we're moving on,
{\an8}uh, with a new journey.
The real objective is to grow.
We need to go to the next level
if we wanna be part of the… of the best.
[Buxton] It's a tough spot for Esteban.
He's got new management in place,
new people to impress
at the top table of the team.
So he has to perform, he has to deliver.
As Alpine vie to climb the ladder
to the top of Formula 1 once again,
they have an ace up their sleeve,
two-time Formula 1 World Champion,
Fernando Alonso.
[Alonso] Right or left?
[Ocon] Whoo!
[Rossi] Well,
it's a statement of ambition.
I mean, uh, Fernando is arguably
one of the best drivers ever.
Having him on board means
expectations are gonna be higher
and the pressure is gonna be on.
The legend himself. I mean, fantastic.
I was, uh, nine years old
when I was watching him
in the Renault back in the days.
When you have a guy like that next to you,
 you can't just be sleeping on the wheel!
Now I feel at the peak of my life
It'll be a long afternoon.
With Esteban, it's going very well.
You always help the younger driver.
Oh shit! We're gonna
be there the whole day.
{\an8}You share your knowledge about the car
or about the previous experiences.
And this year, we're working together
as a very good team.
[photographer] Perfect, thank you.
We're not here to, like,
fool around in the back
of the… of the pack.
Alpine is fighting for fifth this season,
and as such, we're fighting AlphaTauri
very directly.
We're clearly the underdog
in that fight with Alpine
and, you know, they're a big manufacturer.
[Buxton] Like Alpine have with Alonso,
AlphaTauri has an experienced race winner
in Pierre Gasly.
[Gasly] It makes such a big difference
on the first lap.
[Buxton] And with their young driver,
Yuki, they have a driver with potential.
-[Tsunoda] Little bit massage?
-Okay, we can make that happen.
[Tsunoda] I want to go first poo.
But he's still unquestionably
a diamond in the rough.
[tires screeching]
[Tost groaning]
What is he doing?
[Tsunoda] Fuck! Sorry!
Yeah, the beginning of the season
was really bad.
I think I'm an aggressive driver.
This fucking traffic!
Like, fuck, I can't do anything!
I get really heated when I'm in the car.
Fucking Pérez!
He fucking doesn't even look.
Sometimes too much.
Fuck off!
He's a fucking cunt.
[chuckles]
I don't think his radio messages
are meant aggressively.
[Tsunoda] So unstable.
This is a kid who's grown up
in the world of motor racing
and has learned his English
around engineers and mechanics.
[Tsunoda] I can't
fucking believe this car!
[groaning]
[Tost in Italian] For fuck's sake.
[engineer in English]
Surprised at the reaction.
-[Carroll] Super disappointing.
-Yeah.
[Tsunoda] That was a nice poo.
There's an amazing racing driver in Yuki.
Everyone sees it.
But he has to start ironing out
the mistakes and bringing home the points.

My job for this year
is to get points as much as possible,
to help to get team championship
fifth position.
[Tost] Okay, gents.
Alpine is just behind us.
We need every point.
And respect what we tell you.
We need communication from you,
from the drivers.
[Spini] Okay, let's go.
Okay, Yuki, focus on tires and brakes.
{\an8}[Tsunoda] Copy.

[tires screeching]
[commentator 3] <i>Tsunoda's off.</i>
[Tsunoda] Fuck! Sorry!
[Spini]<i> Are you okay? Are you okay?</i>
[Tsunoda] I'm okay.
Yuki makes a bit too many mistakes.
Just, like,
pushing really hard all the time,
and I guess
he's just finding the right balance.
[Spini] Can you switch it on?
[Tsunoda] No gear. No gear.
I can't go in first gear somehow.
[Spini] Pull the clutch, upshift to first.
<i>-</i>[Tsunoda] <i>Yeah, no gear.</i>
-[Spini] Okay. Stop. Engine stop.
[Tost] You can't brake so much like that.
He's on the limit here.
He lost it once more.
He must be concentrated.
[Spini] Yeah.
-[Tost] We must work on this.
-[Spini] Yeah.
[commentator 2] <i>Qualifying crashes</i>
<i>are becoming a bit of a thing for Tsunoda.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>At what point does Tsunoda</i>
<i>start coming under pressure?</i>
<i>Red Bull are ruthless</i>
<i>with young drivers coming through.</i>
<i>We've seen it so many times before.</i>
[laughing] He's expensive as well,
'cause he has shunted
a couple of cars already.
{\an8}[Tost] I call it crash period.
He overdrove the car,
and he crashed heavily in the qualifying.
This is what I said to him,
"Yuki, be careful, you are on the limit.
You can't drive much faster."
For sure he thought, "Mm. This idiot."
"I will show him now
how good I am really,"
and then he crashed.
[commentator 1] <i>Esteban Ocon.</i>
{\an8}<i>French driver racing</i>
<i>for a French-owned team</i>
{\an8}<i>in the French Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Would love to celebrate</i>
<i>by going into the top ten.</i>
[Rossi] The French Grand Prix
is a lot of pressure for us
because it has high expectations.
-[cheering]
-In France, we love our racing.
[commentator 1]
<i>Where can Esteban Ocon put his car?</i>
[Peckett] <i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>that was close. P11.</i>
[Ocon] Yeah, copy.
[Peckett] <i>We'll debrief.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>That's not the result</i>
<i>Alpine would have been looking for.</i>
[Buxton] In such a tight fight for fifth
in the Constructors' Championship,
Alpine and AlphaTauri
need both junior drivers to be performing
and to be bringing home points
every weekend.
[tense music playing]
[commentator 2]
<i>It's the historic French Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Fifty-three laps of pure speed.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>It's lights out and away we go!</i>
[engine revving]
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>Only ten laps to go.</i>
{\an8}<i>Hamilton is fighting to stay at the front</i>
{\an8}<i>while in the middle of the field,</i>
{\an8}<i>Esteban Ocon is battling</i>
<i>to maintain his position.</i>
[Peckett] <i>Okay, Esteban, Ricciardo behind.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>This is Daniel Ricciardo on Esteban Ocon.</i>
-[Ocon] I can't do anything, guys.
-Yeah, copy that, Esteban. Copy that.
[commentator 1]
<i>Ocon has now dropped back to 14th.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>He's not really been</i>
<i>entirely comfortable this whole race.</i>
[in French] We must become competitive.
I agree. It's unbearable.
[commentator 1 in English] <i>Yuki Tsunoda's</i>
<i>AlphaTauri, ahead of Esteban Ocon in 13th.</i>
{\an8}[Spini] Yuki,
we can push one step more on tires.
Ocon one second behind.
[Tsunoda] Yeah, I'm trying to.
[man in Italian] Fucking hell.
[commentator 4 in English]
<i>He's struggling.</i>
[Peckett] <i>Okay, Tsunoda ahead struggling,</i>
<i>a second slower.</i>
<i>Let's go get him.</i>
[Ocon] All right.
[Peckett] <i>Let's pick our pace up.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
[Spini] <i>Two laps to go, Yuki.</i>
<i>Let's keep up the pace.</i>
You can push harder.
[Tsunoda] I am! Shut up!
[Spini] Yuki, calm down, okay?
[commentator 1] <i>Esteban Ocon,</i>
<i>Yuki Tsunoda scrapping away.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>If either can score,</i>
<i>it'll be crucially important</i>
<i>for their teams.</i>
[Peckett] <i>Come on, Esteban, let's go.</i>
[in French] He must go for it now.
[commentator 1 in English] <i>Last lap.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>It will be</i>
<i>Gasly in seventh</i>
<i>and Alonso coming across the line, P8.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>And it's 14th</i>
<i>for Esteban Ocon.</i>
<i>Disappointing for the Frenchman.</i>
[Ocon] Fuckin' hell.
Fuck!
[Spini] <i>P13, Yuki, P13.</i>
[Tsunoda] Yeah.
To be honest, I'm not happy
with this car. It's so unstable.
<i>It's pissed me off. I hate it.</i>
[Tost] Okay, Yuki.
[commentator 3] <i>Thirteenth and 14th</i>
<i>will leave both Tsunoda and Ocon</i>
<i>out of the points today.</i>
[Carroll] Hey, mate. Tough luck, buddy.
It was still a great race.
[woman] Is he still shouting?
[Carroll] He has stopped.
Fuckin' hell.
[Rossi] Drivers are athletes.
A little wrinkle in their confidence
and then the performance goes astray.
[Ocon in French] There's nothing to do.
Catastrophe.
[Rossi in English] It's really important
that Esteban doesn't lose his confidence.
Can you give us a break, please?
One second. Thanks.
[Alonso] For Esteban, this year,
it's a new team, a new philosophy.
In Formula 1,
you are dealing with a lot of things.
Maybe you are very talented on track,
but you are not delivering
what the people are expecting from you.
[Ocon] I still hate losing.
I can't stand it.
I feel ashamed, you know?
It's quite easy, you know,
to let yourself go down
in times where, you know,
maybe it's not working the way you want.
The amount of pressure is huge
compared to other categories
and this is a definite learning,
um… learning curve.
{\an8}Esteban could have done better.
[Rossi] We keep having
only one car scoring the points.
That's a problem.
It's the same weaknesses race after race.
I need to make sure
that whenever I spot a weakness,
something that's not working,
that's not helping us
going towards the, uh… the goal,
I correct it.
[in French] We just need to make progress.
[in English] That's my, uh, job.
[Tost in Italian]
His approach has to be better.
Needs to work more.
[woman] What do you mean? Physically?
[Tost] Just generally.
[in German]
He needs to have a more balanced life.
He's a lazy dog otherwise.
He needs to work now
for the first time in his life.
[in English] It feels like
he just needs a tighter set of reins.
'Cause he's a fantastic character,
he's obviously talented.
[Tost] He's really talented.
[Horner] He just needs
the Franz finishing school.
[Tost] You all do.
[Horner chuckles]
[tense musical flourish]
[Tsunoda] I got it.
[clanging]
[Lawson] Oh my God, mate.
This is a lot of rain.
-I don't think your boot's big enough.
-[Tsunoda] Yeah.
[Lawson] Put it in the passenger door.
[Tsunoda] Franz said
he wants me to live in Italy.
My driving style,
I was going too aggressive,
and I crashed it,
and I think I lost a little bit
of confidence for the driving.
-[Tsunoda] Oh my God.
-[Lawson] Nice.
-Good to go, mate.
-[Tsunoda] Yeah.
So, I'll see what's gonna happen.
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck in Faenza.
-See you soon.
-Bye, Yuki.
Bye.
[engine revving]
[birdsong]
-[fussing]
-[cat purring]
It's a lucky black cat. [chuckles]
I just love to come back
to the family place as much as I can.
You know, after not having
the best first of 2021,
they kept supporting me
all the way throughout.
[mom in French] On the day after the race,
I am always aching.
[in English] She has neck pain
after the race, she said!
[in French] I swear,
I crane my head during the turns.
[Ocon] Really?
-You imitate my moves?
-I imitate your moves.
[Ocon in English] I've worked hard
to arrive to my goal
and my life is working
around Formula 1, so yeah.
-[in French] Is it burning? It's so hot.
-[chuckling]
[Ocon in English]
What I like is to be with my family.
I've learned, with experience,
to have a solid platform
when you are a sportsman.
When I go there,
it reboots me to…
to go back to race, as simple as that.
[remote control car engine revs]
[laughter]
[Tsunoda] Good morning.
[Carroll] Morning, Yuki-san.
Or <i>"Buongiorno."</i>
-How are you doing?
-[Carroll] Good.
-I'm excited.
-I'm not.
-You're not excited?
-No. We're training.
-[Carroll] It's gonna be great.
-Good.
When I have workouts,
especially in the morning,
it just ruins my whole day.
[Carroll] Come on, buddy.
[Tsunoda] Just makes muscles tired,
sweat a lot.
I hurt a lot,
so I can't finish this training.
[Tost] Yuki moved
from Milton Keynes to Faenza
because we wanted him
to have a daily routine.
-[Tsunoda] Am I allowed the toilet?
-[Carroll] No.
[Tost] I said to him,
"Now, look, you are in Formula 1,
but you haven't achieved anything."
"To become a successful driver,
they have to train every day,
minimum two to four hours."
[Tsunoda] Franz is a really nice guy
and, you know, I like him,
but at the same time,
he's really, um, strict.
I don't like training,
but I have to, so…
I just have to survive it. [chuckles]
[exerted gasp]
[Tost] He must train a lot.
He must do a lot of exercises,
uh, on the physical side,
on the mental side,
but also on the technical side
with the engineers to analyze the race.
-[Tsunoda] Yo.
-[Spini] Hey.
Heading to Hungary
will be a lot of low-speed corners,
so a lot of rotation required.
So turn one, turn two
are very long corners.
Turn 13, very long corner.
[Tsunoda] It's like school,
going back to school,
which I don't like much,
but I just have to learn a lot of things,
so it is really hard work.
[Spini] One-stop is feasible.
[Tost] If you are lazy,
you don't care about anything,
you will not have the success,
but then the career is over.
We will see.
[commentator 1]
<i>Welcome to beautiful Budapest,</i>

-[Alonso] I don't know!
-Couldn't sleep?
[Ricciardo] I need a pee so bad.
-Do you?
-[Ricciardo] Yeah.
[Tsunoda] Yo, Checo.

-[Tsunoda] Good, thanks.
[wheel gun whirring]
[Gasly] So when do we do another podium?
-[woman] Here!
-[Gasly laughs]
[Leclerc] You all right? How are you?
I put money on you again.
-Oh! I won't.
-Don't disappoint me.
How you getting on there? Aw.
In the paddock,
somebody might think you've been shot!
[laughter]
-[Sainz] What's your forecast saying?
-[Norris] Rain.
[commentator 1] <i>It's gonna be tricky</i>
<i>in greasy conditions</i>
<i>because the rain has arrived</i>
<i>just to put another little twist</i>
<i>into what could be a fascinating</i>
<i>and an enthralling afternoon.</i>
[Buxton] Yuki, he needs
to just keep his head together
and prove that he can finish on Sunday
with a good result.
Esteban, after a really difficult period
this season,
needs to move forward
from scraping into the points
to turn his season around.
[Ocon] You don't realize
how lucky you can be sometimes.
I've paid the price in the past.
It hasn't been easy.
But I made it back.
I'm 100% serious and up for the job.
[commentator 2] <i>All the cars are lined up,</i>
<i>ready to go in the Hungarian Grand Prix.</i>
[Tsunoda] Being rookie in Formula 1
is really difficult.
{\an8}[Spini] <i>Okay, Yuki,</i>
<i>we need good communication.</i>
[Tsunoda] Yeah, 100%.
I always have pressure,
but I know what I have to achieve.
[commentator 1] <i>Are you ready</i>
<i>for some action?</i>
{\an8}<i>All the talking stops right now.</i>
{\an8}<i>It's lights out and away we go.</i>
<i>There goes Lando Norris down the inside.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Bottas hits Norris!</i>
<i>And Norris hits Verstappen!</i>
[groaning]
{\an8}[Pérez] What an idiot!
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Pérez gets caught up</i>
<i>in that as well.</i>
{\an8}[Leclerc] Fuck! Shit!
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Chaos behind!</i>
{\an8}[Max] What the fuck happened there?
{\an8}[Bottas] Sorry, guys.
[commentator 1] <i>We have lost four drivers</i>
<i>from this Hungarian Grand Prix</i>
<i>in the space of about 600 meters.</i>
[Peckett] Update us when you can, Esteban.
[Ocon] When there's a crash,
everything slows down.
It's all about seeing, anticipating.
You need to keep calm.
Just thinking calmly, it's the best way
also to have everything under control.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Esteban Ocon showed</i>
<i>so much composure to avoid the melee.</i>
[Peckett] <i>We're sat in P2</i>
<i>at the moment. Nice work.</i>
{\an8}[Tsunoda] What's happened here?
[Spini] Yuki, there's been an accident
turn one and turn two.
<i>You are doing good.</i>
Red flag. Red flag.
[commentator 1] <i>We are stopping this race</i>
<i>while the marshals clear the debris.</i>
{\an8}[Peckett] <i>Okay, Esteban, well done so far.</i>
{\an8}<i>Well managed.</i>
{\an8}[Ocon] Copy.
{\an8}[Buxton] This unique circumstance,
someone's crashed,
{\an8}these are the races
where anything can happen,
{\an8}and if the opportunity presents itself,
you have to hang on to it with both hands.
{\an8}[Spini] <i>So, Yuki, currently we are P5.</i>
[Tsunoda] Copy.
[commentator 2] <i>What a chaotic start.</i>
<i>In second place now is Esteban Ocon,</i>
<i>and Yuki Tsunoda is up into fifth.</i>
<i>That's unbelievable.</i>
[Buxton] You're only as good
as your last race.
All it takes is one good result
to completely switch that downward spiral
into a sudden upward trajectory.
Genuinely, anybody could be on the podium.
Yeah.
[commentator 3] <i>Lewis Hamilton will</i>
<i>lead the field away for a formation lap</i>
<i>and then a standing start.</i>
<i>Everyone is still on wet-weather tires.</i>
{\an8}[Spini] <i>Okay, Yuki, sun is coming out.</i>
{\an8}<i>-Track is drying up.</i>
-[Tsunoda] Copy.
[Ocon] Completely dry.
{\an8}As soon as we can pit,
it's going to be good to do so.
[Peckett] You can come in at the end
of this lap if you wanted.
[commentator 2] <i>Lewis Hamilton leads them</i>
<i>round the final few corners.</i>
<i>Is he going to dive into the pit lane?</i>
{\an8}[Lewis] Control the pace now, yeah?
{\an8}[Bono] <i>Yeah, copy.</i>
{\an8}<i>It is a standing start. Standing start.</i>
{\an8}[Peckett] <i>Okay, Esteban, box. Box. Box.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Second-place Esteban Ocon</i>
<i>comes into the pits.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>And behind Ocon,</i>
<i>the rest of the field is pitting as well.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Lewis Hamilton is gonna be</i>
<i>the only driver on wet-weather tires</i>
{\an8}<i>on a perfectly bone-dry track.</i>
{\an8}-[Lewis] Loads in the pit lane already?
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Yeah, roger.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>All the other drivers</i>

-[Lewis] Yeah, it's dry.
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Yeah, copy, Lewis.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>And there goes Hamilton</i>
<i>past the pit lane now.</i>
<i>He's got to do a whole other lap</i>
<i>before he changes his tires.</i>
[Bono] <i>Box, box.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Mercedes made</i>
<i>a huge error here.</i>
-[Lewis] Am I last?
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Yeah.</i>
{\an8}[Lewis] Get on it
for the rest of the race.
[commentator 3] <i>Sixty-five laps to go.</i>
<i>Hamilton now at the back.</i>
{\an8}<i>And for the first time in his career,</i>
{\an8}<i>Esteban Ocon leads.</i>
[Peckett] <i>Okay, Esteban,</i>
<i>you are leading the Grand Prix.</i>
<i>Let's get down to business.</i>
[Ocon] Yeah, let's focus.
[Peckett] Vettel 1.1 behind.
Keep that pace up if you can.
[commentator 3] <i>It's gonna be so tough</i>
<i>for Ocon to keep Vettel behind.</i>
<i>Vettel is on the attack</i>
<i>and getting closer.</i>
<i>This is anyone's race.</i>
{\an8}[Spini] <i>How is the balance?</i>
{\an8}[Tsunoda] The rear is quite strong.
{\an8}[Spini] <i>Okay, Yuki, you're doing good.</i>
Keep your head down, keep focus.
[Tsunoda] Copy.
[commentator 2] <i>Here's Hamilton now</i>
<i>on fresh tires and picking up the pace.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>He's gonna</i>
<i>get past Max Verstappen.</i>
<i>Can he get past Danny Ricciardo as well?</i>
[commentator 3] <i>He does,</i>
<i>and with 49 laps remaining,</i>
<i>it looks like he's set his sights</i>
<i>on Esteban Ocon.</i>
{\an8}[Peckett] Okay, Esteban, Hamilton,
eight and a half seconds behind.
{\an8}[Ocon] What's Hamilton's pace?
{\an8}[Peckett] <i>Twenty-two zero, so let's push.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Ocon in the lead,</i>
<i>but he has two world champions,</i>
<i>Vettel and Hamilton, at his heels.</i>
<i>How long can he hold them off?</i>
[Peckett] <i>Gap to Vettel, one second.</i>
[Ocon] Copy that.
[commentator 2] <i>Could be</i>
<i>a big points haul for AlphaTauri.</i>
<i>Yuki Tsunoda running in sixth place,</i>
<i>driving really consistently.</i>
{\an8}-[Tsunoda] How many more laps?
-[Spini] Six laps.
[commentator 3] <i>This could be</i>
<i>his highest ever finish in Formula 1.</i>
[Tsunoda] <i>I have to push.</i>
[groans]
[Tost in Italian] Has he gone out?
[Spini in English] <i>Yuki?</i>
<i>Do you need support?</i>
[Tsunoda] No.
[Tost in Italian] Good. Well done.
-[in English] <i>Okay. Good job.</i>
-[Tsunoda] Ah, copy.
[commentator 2] <i>At the front of the race,</i>
<i>Vettel is in second,</i> <i>right behind Ocon.</i>
[Peckett] <i>Vettel 0.9 behind.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>This is huge pressure</i>
<i>for someone trying</i>
<i>to win their first Grand Prix.</i>
[in French] So we're gonna see
what Este can do.
I have faith.
[commentator 2 in English] <i>Vettel's close</i>
<i>this time. He's gonna go for it.</i>
<i>Ocon holds him off, just about.</i>
-[commentator 3] <i>And Ocon still leads.</i>
-[cheering]

{\an8}<i>Can he win</i>

{\an8}[Peckett] Last lap. Max push. Max push.
[Spini] Last lap, Yuki, last lap.
{\an8}-Keep up the pace.
-[Tsunoda] Copy.
[commentator 2] <i>A couple of corners to go.</i>

First victory. First of many.
[commentator 3] <i>Yuki Tsunoda, sixth place,</i>
<i>eight points, his highest ever finish.</i>
<i>AlphaTauri will take that.</i>
[Spini] <i>P6, Yuki.</i>
[Tsunoda] Important points, yeah?
[Spini] Yeah, important points.
Best race you've done this year,
so we'll build up from here.
[Tsunoda] Yeah.
Well done, guys. You did
a really good job. Thanks. I'm happy.
[Spini] Yeah, you should be.
[Tsunoda] I think living in Faenza
is making me a better driver,
and I realize that communication
is really important in Formula 1.
[Tost] Yuki did everything
absolutely correct.
Sixth place, we scored points,
and I think that he can have
quite a successful future in Formula 1.
[woman] Yuki, well done!
This is just the beginning.
[cheering, whistling]
[Ocon] When I crossed the line,
the first thing that I remember
is all the difficult moments I had
in my career.
All the sacrifices that my family made.
[announcer] <i>And our winner,</i>
<i>from France, Esteban Ocon!</i>
[applause, cheering]
I have no doubt
Esteban has true greatness.
[Ocon] You work 20 years of your life
to get that taste,
and finally you are living it.
I'm very proud,
and I hope this is the start of many more.
[crowd chanting] Ocon! Ocon!
Ocon! Ocon! Ocon! Ocon!
{\an8}Sign here? It's a Mercedes cap.
{\an8}-[man] Yeah, that's next year, isn't it?
-[laughter]
[Toto] George could be
somebody to reckon with.
I need to show them that I'm the one.
-As I pulled out, he jolted to the right.
-Clearly it was his fault.
[Buxton] There are doubts
for Toto about George.
{\an8}Oh my God, we have loads to talk about.
{\an8}[commentator] <i>Max Verstappen</i>
<i>is under investigation.</i>
[Lewis] Was that a penalty then?
[engineer] Five places.
You're fucking joking.
-We'll throw everything at it.
-[Buxton] Final race of the year.
<i>-</i>[commentator] <i>Verstappen closes in.</i>
-[Lewis] Fuck. He right behind me?
[dramatic music playing]-[in Finnish] Here we go again.
-Here we go again.
-The training has gone well all winter.
-It was a good winter. It's been diverse.
Pretty much the best shape I've been in.
Yes, I think so.
If the races go badly
it won't be because of me.
Definitely not.
[Bottas in English] Every single driver
would do anything to get into my seat.
{\an8}If I wanna stay with the team,
I need to perform.
{\an8}That's how it goes in this sport.
[cars zooming]
I'm racing for my future.
-[engines revving]
-[crowd cheering]
[in Finnish] The hungry wolf
runs the furthest.
[reporter in English] Do you work
for your future or leave it to your agent?
[Bottas] I try to focus on driving,
so yes, I leave it
to the people helping me.
[Buxton] This season is huge for Valtteri.
{\an8}Coming into 2021,
there's a lot of speculation
{\an8}that this could be Valtteri Bottas's fifth
and final year at Mercedes.
[Toto] There's a question mark
over Valtteri.
With many young
and upcoming drivers in the teams,
we have always looked into the future.
{\an8}That's the nature of the game.
[man in French] Mercedes will change
at the end of the year.
{\an8}I need to learn German.
{\an8}[Toto in English] Obviously,
you're our works driver
{\an8}in Mercedes in Formula E,
{\an8}but you and I will always discuss
what the career opportunities are.
[Vandoorne] Yeah, I think
we should have a chat, you know.
[Toto] The drivers are refreshing,
the next generation coming up.
[engineer] Lando and George as well.
[Toto] That's really
where the future lies.
[Buxton] There is an incredible stable
of young drivers
who would do anything
for that second Mercedes seat.
But there's one clear favorite.
The race for the second seat
is between Valtteri
and the excitement of a new young driver.
A very difficult decision.
[crowd cheering faintly]
[machinery whirring]
[engine revving]
[peaceful music playing]
[Russell] Like that photo
I sent you last night?
{\an8}[Casanavos] Yeah. Did you buy it or no?
{\an8}[Russell] Yeah, I did buy it.
{\an8}There's some fake merchandise
that they're sort of taking down.
"Racing Babes" had some underwear
with my face on it.
-So I got it for my girlfriend's birthday.
-[Casanavos chuckles]
I won't show you the photo
of her wearing it!
[both chuckle]
[upbeat dance music playing]
[Russell] Aleix is a great trainer,
but the exercises he has me doing
makes me look like a right dick.
[Casanavos chuckles]
[breathing heavily]
This here is one of my personal favorites.
A combination of wrestling
and <i>Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>
[Casanavos laughs]
[Casanavos] Come on, come on.
[Russell] Williams is like a…
a family to me.
Between the mid-'80s and the late '90s,
Williams were the most successful team
in Formula 1,
but unfortunately, we've finished last
for the past two seasons.
[indistinct chattering]
[Capito] George is exceptional.
It's not just his driving skills.
{\an8}He is motivating the team
to do the very best for him.
And of course there is a huge interest
in what he's doing in the future.
I would love to him to stay.
[Buxton] Everyone knows
what George's future is.
It's fighting for victories.
It's fighting for world titles.
So of course George wants Valtteri's seat.
And there's good reason
why he could get it.
George Russell's been part
of the Mercedes junior team
for a number of years.
They have a very close relationship
with Williams.
They provide their engines
and other support to the team.
However, the very smallest percentage
of academy drivers
will make it then to the top team.
But George was given a golden opportunity
to prove himself last year.

<i>All different this evening,</i>
<i>even though there are two Mercedes</i>
<i>on the front row.</i>
<i>Valtteri Bottas on pole.</i>
<i>It's George Russell deputizing</i>
<i>for Lewis Hamilton.</i>
<i>The world champion</i>
<i>tested positive for COVID-19.</i>
I lined up second on the grid
and it felt natural.
I didn't think, "Fucking hell, I'm on
the front row of a Formula 1 race."
[commentator 1] <i>George Russell's</i>
<i>previous best qualifying was 12th.</i>
[Toto] I seen George, a very ambitious
and talented young racing driver
that hasn't been able
to drive a competitive car.
It's exciting to have a young driver,
give him the opportunity,
and find out whether he can
one day take over the baton.
{\an8}[engines revving]
[commentator 1] <i>Russell does get away well</i>
<i>and takes the lead</i>
<i>of the Sakhir Grand Prix!</i>
{\an8}[Bottas] What the fuck was that?
{\an8}[Russell] The overtake on Valtteri
created this spark and this tension
between the two of us.
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>That was committed,</i>
<i>it was brave, it was brilliant.</i>
[Russell] So I thought,
"We're gonna bloody win this."
{\an8}And then suddenly…
{\an8}This is a genuine puncture.
{\an8}[groans] I don't know what to say!
{\an8}I'm absolutely gutted,
{\an8}but I <i>hope</i> we get this opportunity again.
{\an8}[Bono] <i>You really showed strength.</i>
{\an8}[Toto] George, I'm sorry for that.
That was a brilliant, brilliant drive.
[Russell groans]
A puncture.
You're fucking kidding me.
Fuck. You know, I just missed out
on winning my first ever Formula 1 race,
something I've dreamt of my whole life.
I obviously got
an incredible opportunity with Mercedes.
What we achieved over the course
of that weekend filled me with confidence
because I thought,
in the right car at the right time,
I know I can do it.
[tense dance music playing]
[man shouting indistinctly]
[woman giggling]
-[Russell] I've no idea what he said.
-Imagine if you didn't understand.
-"George! George!"
-[giggling]
{\an8}-[Carmen] Can I have a iced americano?
-[server] Yeah.
{\an8}-With… Sorry, do you have soya milk?
-Yeah.
{\an8}With a bit of soya milk.
-Thank you.
-And an iced latte for me.
Any milk. Normal milk's fine, thank you.
[Carmen] Thank you very much.
Have a lovely day. Bye.
[man] Excuse me,
would I be able to get a photo?
-No worries.
-Massive fucking fan.
-With her?
-[man] Um…
-[Carmen chuckles]
-If you want!
Want me to take it?
Literally a massive fan.
Jesus Christ, I didn't expect this today.
[shutter clicks]
-Nice one. Have a good day.
-Cheers.
[Carmen] Bye.
I definitely noticed a difference
in how known I was
after that race in Bahrain.
Just more of a spotlight around me.
It's not something I'm chasing at all,
but it just comes with the job.
I want to drive cars and I wanna win.
Thank you very much.
How are you feeling about this season?
[Russell] I don't know.
Still just too far away.
You know, the car's
just still not quick enough. And it's…
Even when we do an amazing job,
it's just not enough.
Yeah.
-It will come.
-I know.
-I'm not patient.
-[chuckles]
I'm not patient with anything.
I want my food now and I wanna win now!
I want everything now.
This is my last season
contracted to Williams.
That means Mercedes and Toto
decide whether I end up
in a Mercedes Formula 1 car
next year or not,
but I need to go out there
and… um, show them that I'm the one.

or looking to the future?
We had a very stable,
well-working relationship
between Valtteri,
and then you have
the exciting young talent coming up,
and you just need to evaluate one,
um, against the other.
We're gonna sit with the drivers
and discuss and come up with a decision.
-[interviewer] Before the summer break?
-Maybe.
[Bottas] At Mercedes, I've been
pretty much always through my career
with one-year contracts.
[entry system beeps]
And of course
they're always looking at options,
if they think they can find
a better driver pairing.
I know that George
is gonna come after my seat.
Of course I'll fight for it.

[Buxton] Can George Russell,

It's gonna to be a thrilling Grand Prix.

{\an8}[Bottas] What a fucking cunt.
[Russell] Is he a fucking prick or what?
[tense music playing]
{\an8}<i>-</i>[Riki] <i>Are you okay, Valtteri?</i>
-Yeah.
At first, I thought, like,
maybe he was there to check if I'm okay.
Obviously that wasn't the case.
He was pissed off.
In response, gave him a hand signal.
[Russell] I said, "Are you trying
to kill us?" I don't think he heard me,
and he just called me a C-U-N-T,
um…
and stuck his finger up at me.
[Bottas] He wasn't very happy.
And I didn't understand
what it was all about.
Clearly it was his fault,
so it was quite surprising.
A lot more important,
because zero points from that race.
George had an opportunity to overtake.
I think it was
a bit of a kamikaze, um, project.
Ending up in the wall
with 50-plus G is never nice.
Valtteri could have been, um, injured.
[Horner] Good job
you're in one piece, huh?
[reporter 1] Talk us through it.
Tell us what happened.
[Russell] Just as I pulled out,
he jolted very slightly to the right.
Because it was Valtteri,
because of the history,
and because of everything that's going on,
you have these thoughts.
"Did he do it because it was me?"
[reporter 2] Have you spoken
to Valtteri and George?
[Toto] I have spoken to Valtteri,
who didn't have a lot
of friendly things to say.
Um, and I haven't seen George yet.
-[engineer] He's okay.
-[Toto] Did he tell you why?
[engineer] I've spoken to them.
We went outside and had a chat.
Came back in
and said, "Stop attacking each other."
[Toto] With a young driver,
you need to expect mistakes,
but things that would be inexcusable
are arrogance,
a sense of entitlement,
and a… approach of "It wasn't my fault."
"It's always someone else's mistake."
[Buxton] Take out the car
of the team that you're trying to impress
and then refuse to apologize for it?
For Toto, moments like that
are going to allow doubts to creep in.
Of course Toto wants a fast driver,
but he also needs somebody
who's reliable and isn't reckless
if they're gonna sit
next to Lewis next year.
Is George ready?
Does he have the right mindset,
the right mentality?
Is he a team player?
'Cause Valtteri,
look, he might not have ultimate pace,
but he's not smashing the car up
every weekend.
[dance music playing]
{\an8}[Vierula in Finnish]
Sharply up from there.
{\an8}Two more still.
Give the last one your all.
Good.
That's enough squatting.
Throw it back firmly.
One more.
[Vierula grunts]
[Bottas] Let's see how the season will go.
[Vierula] If there are crashes,
you just gotta reset.
[Bottas] Yeah.
You can't lose any energy to the fact
that you mess up or anything.
It can get to you for a little while.
It's always the same thing.
To get through those moments
and take it one race at a time.
[Vierula] Sure.
And stay levelheaded.
I need to make sure I don't screw up.
[Vierula] What's the biggest target
for the races?
The fact that when we get
to the end of the season,
I want to be able to look in the mirror
and say I gave my everything.
[Bottas in English] It's a funny sport.
It's so much about in the head
and the mental performance.
Knowing that you have a few months
to prove your worth,
it can affect you.
But at this point in the season,
no wins yet,
so I need to focus
on this championship right now.
[commentator 1]
<i>Welcome, everybody, to Silverstone,</i>
<i>the birthplace</i>
<i>of the Formula 1 World Championship</i>
<i>ahead of the British Grand Prix.</i>
{\an8}[Buxton] Coming into
the British Grand Prix,
{\an8}it's clear who fans want
in that Mercedes seat next year.
-[man 1] Amazing. Thank you very much.
-Thank you. Cheers, everyone.
{\an8}-You want a signature?
-[Steiner] Yeah, on my cheek. [laughs]
{\an8}You're holding up everybody.
I cannot even park.
Over the past few weeks,
there have been growing rumors
that Mercedes are about to announce
George Russell in front of his home crowd.
-You want me to sign here?
-[woman] Yeah.
-It's a Mercedes cap.
-[man 2] Yeah. That's next year, isn't it?
-[laughs] Cheers, mate.
-[Russell] See you later.
[man 3] Good luck for the weekend,
and you should be a Mercedes driver.
Thank you.
[Gow] All of a sudden
social media starts lighting up.
{\an8}Multiple sources are claiming
that this is gonna happen.
[social media notifications ping]
[keyboard clacking]
[Gow] It takes on a life of its own,
and even F1 itself dropped a press release
saying it could happen this weekend.
-[Russell] We're both going up, yeah?
-No.
[Gow] Silverstone is the penultimate race
before Toto's summer-break deadline,
so the timing makes perfect sense
for an announcement about the second seat.
What's going on here?
[crowd cheering]
-Right, give us a cheer.
-[cheering]
[whooping, whistling]
Instagram story shortly.
Don't you worry. Don't you worry.
I feel like a rockstar here.
[crowd chants] George Russell!
George Russell! George Russell!
-[Russell] How we doing? All right?
-How you doing?
-I'm good. You?
-Yeah, good.
I'll just skim through it,
just the… the key points.
Obviously, um,
F1 had it in their broadcasting notes
that went out this morning
that, um, apparently an announcement
from Mercedes, announcing you,
was imminent,
uh, which Mercedes questioned,
and they've now removed that.
[tense music playing]
That wasn't particularly helpful
to, uh… [laughs]
…to tell broadcasters that was happening
when it's not happening.
Thanks, guys.
Have a good one.
[Buxton] Mercedes were very swift
to cut those rumors down
and say that nothing been decided.
Negotiations over driver contracts
are notoriously precarious.
You could think that you're a shoo-in,
and drivers have.
And they've had everything
pulled from underneath them
at the eleventh hour.
It happens every year.
[tense electronic music playing]
[Ricciardo] Thought you'd remember
this beautiful face.
[Jackie Stewart] Yeah, of course I do.
It's a pity you don't smile more.
[Ricciardo laughs]
I'll see you, mate.
Have a good weekend.
-[Russell] All good?
-Yeah. Yourself?
-Ready for it. Have a good one.
-[Lewis] And you, mate.
-[Tiffany] Are you ready for today?
-[Bottas] Yes.
[Tiffany] Treat it like any other race.
Just go out and try and win.
{\an8}[Bottas] Thanks, honey.
{\an8}-Easy, right? [chuckles]
-[Bottas] Yeah.
That's what everybody thinks.
No, I'm sure you'll be fine.
[Bottas] Every race is important,
but I think at this moment of the season,
and, yeah, my situation, I think it's…
very important.
After this, I'm ready.
I've always been alongside Lewis
in the support role.
But I wouldn't be at Mercedes
if I wasn't selfish at times.
The best way for my future,
I guess, is to win races,
so that's, of course, the goal.
[Tiffany] What's gonna be the plan?
[Bottas] One stop.
Fuck them all.
[cell phone rings]
{\an8}Hi, James.
<i>-</i>[Vowles] <i>Hi, Toto.</i>
-Hi.
[Vowles] <i>It's about Valtteri.</i>
<i>Can you talk briefly?</i>
Yes.
So, what do you want to tell him?
[Vowles] <i>The only way to win</i>
<i>this drivers' championship</i>
<i>and this championship together</i>
<i>is by applying team orders</i>
<i>in a strict way.</i>
<i>"If you're ahead of Lewis,</i>
<i>we can safely invert the cars."</i>
<i>It's likely that if we can safely</i>
<i>do team orders, we will do.</i>
<i>And it's very harsh</i>
<i>and it's very straightforward.</i>
<i>And he'll be frustrated and upset.</i>
<i>I know that.</i>
[Toto] Yeah, I'll do that.
Team orders are a situation where
you're reversing your own cars on track
in order to maximize the point-scoring
of the championship leader.
It is the last thing you want to do,
but sometimes every team owner
and team principal
needs to make tough decisions.
[Gow] Coming into Silverstone,
Toto is desperate
for Lewis Hamilton to stay in contention
for this World Championship.
Toto is fully prepared to sacrifice
Valtteri Bottas's position in this race
to help Hamilton.
However, this is a man who wants
to show off to the rest of the paddock
how good a driver he is
so that he gets a seat next year,
so will he be inclined to help Mercedes?
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome.</i>
<i>This is gonna be</i>
<i>the hottest Silverstone race</i>
<i>in over ten years.</i>
Nice one.
[commentator 4] <i>The leading teams</i>
<i>have already secured contracts</i>
<i>with some exciting young talent</i>
<i>for next season.</i>
<i>But there is still uncertainty</i>
<i>about that second seat at Mercedes.</i>
<i>How long before Toto</i>
<i>announces his decision?</i>
<i>Max Verstappen on pole</i>
<i>ahead of Lewis Hamilton.</i>
<i>Valtteri Bottas is third on the grid,</i>
<i>and Britain's George Russell,</i>
<i>who, despite some reports,</i>
<i>looks set to stay at Williams for now,</i>
<i>starts 12th.</i>
{\an8}[Russell] Radio check.
[Urwin] <i>Loud and clear.</i>
{\an8}[Riki] <i>Last car approaching the grid.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[commentator 4]
<i>And we're racing in Silverstone.</i>
{\an8}<i>Hamilton goes for the inside at Copse.</i>
{\an8}<i>And there's contact!</i>
{\an8}[Horner] Fuck!
{\an8}[commentator 4] <i>Verstappen's in the wall</i>
<i>and out of the race.</i>
{\an8}<i>And Hamilton has been given</i>
<i>a ten-second time penalty</i>
{\an8}<i>for causing a collision.</i>
[thrilling music playing]
{\an8}[Riki] Valtteri, fastest man on track.
{\an8}Half a second quicker
than the leaders and Norris behind.
{\an8}[commentator 4] <i>In comes Hamilton,</i>
<i>but he'll have to wait</i>
<i>ten seconds before the tire change.</i>
{\an8}[Bono] Ten-second penalty,
so we'll serve that.
[commentator 4] <i>Hamilton out of the pits,</i>
<i>but he's behind</i>
<i>his teammate Valtteri Bottas,</i>
<i>who now finds himself in second place.</i>
{\an8}[Riki] Valtteri,
so race situation, you are P2.
[Bono] You are fastest man
on track, Lewis.
[Lewis] It's getting harder
to follow Valtteri.
Can't get close, man.
{\an8}[Toto] Get Valtteri, out of the way.
Get out the way.
{\an8}[Riki] Okay, Valtteri.
{\an8}<i>We invert the cars into turn 15 this lap.</i>
{\an8}<i>Do not fight with Lewis.</i>
[Bottas] I think the situation
is quite clear for me.
I don't have a contract for next year,
so sometimes you need to be selfish.
It's a bit of a survival game.
Sometimes it's about individual wins.
{\an8}But in this sport,
if you want to aim for long-term success,
{\an8}you need to play as a team.
{\an8}[Riki] Valtteri?
{\an8}[Bottas] Copy.
[cheering]
[Riki] Thank you, Valtteri.
{\an8}<i>Lewis predicted to catch Leclerc</i>
<i>before the end,</i>
<i>so just try to follow him.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton tries</i>
<i>to get past Leclerc.</i>
{\an8}<i>Has Hamilton gone through? Yes, he has!</i>
[cheering]
[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton chases</i>
<i>the checkered flag.</i>
<i>He wins the British Grand Prix.</i>
{\an8}<i>Valtteri Bottas, a podium</i>
<i>for him, third place.</i>
{\an8}[Vowles] <i>Valtteri, it's James.</i>
<i>Well done. Thank you.</i>
{\an8}<i>You are the reason why we won.</i>
<i>Thank you. Great job.</i>
{\an8}[Bottas] Well done, guys, good job.
{\an8}[commentator 4] <i>Bottas sacrificed himself</i>
<i>for the team</i>
<i>and Lewis Hamilton's championship bid.</i>
{\an8}[Russell] That it?
{\an8}[Urwin] <i>Yeah, that's it. That's it. P12.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
[Gow] Team orders again, though.
Bottas had to get out the way.
You need to give it everything.
As much as we, you know,
love opportunity for everybody,
the fight is just too close.
Valtteri was such a great team player.
[reporter] How does that feel?
[Bottas] It's not the first time,
but the season I've had so far,
um, obviously, I'm pretty much
out of the title fight,
so we play as a team.
Really grateful to my teammate.
A great teammate.
And today, without his participation,
we wouldn't have won the race.
-[celebratory music playing]
-[crowd cheering]
[announcer] <i>In third place,</i>
<i>Valtteri Bottas of Finland!</i>
[crowd applauding, cheering]
[Toto] Valtteri's
understood the big picture.
He has the maturity and experience
that these young guys don't have yet.
[crowd cheering]
[Lewis] Valtteri is
an exceptional driver
and teammate.
There's a great energy
and flow within the team.
{\an8}I think he deserves
to be able to keep his position.
Just keep it the way it is. It works.
[tense music playing]
[crowd whistling, cheering]
[Russell] I want
to prove myself against the best.
I'm not here to celebrate zero points.
Look, Valtteri's made his move,
played the perfect wingman at Silverstone,
but is that enough to keep his seat?
[airplane engine idles]
[Lord] Drivers, what are you thinking
at the moment?
[Toto] If you wanna drive the Mercedes,
you need to be able
to sustain the pressure.
You need to be able
to be thrown in the cold water and swim.
{\an8}I think you can't underestimate
the challenge of being Lewis's teammate.
{\an8}It's… You talk about
Valtteri having fluctuations.
{\an8}It mu… It's hugely challenging
to be up against Lewis in the same car.
[Toto] For stability reasons,
collaboration on setup
with Lewis, pushing Lewis,
Valtteri would be the call.
And he behaves like a Mercedes driver.
He's… He looks like a Mercedes driver.
He's, uh, intelligent.
{\an8}He's been a foundation
of what's been, so far,
{\an8}the longest sustained run of success
of any team.
You have all these kids now
in all the other teams,
in the top teams,
and George, when you look
at his career record, uh…
has been the most successful
of all of them.
[tense music playing]
[Susie] Choosing to replace Valtteri
or not, it's a huge decision.
George is obviously so much younger.
It's not just about how quick they are.
It's how socially intelligent they are
outside of the car,
how they can cope with the expectations
that are put on them.
It's a huge amount of pressure.
It's all really on Toto's shoulders.
[Buxton] Valtteri or George.
Toto said that we will know
who the driver
of that second Mercedes will be
by the summer break.
The longer it goes on,
the more you think that there are doubts
for Toto about George.
When you have the safe,
solid, dependable Valtteri,
the known quantity suddenly starts
to look a lot more attractive.
-[tense music playing]
-[thunder rumbles]
[Toto] Hey, Jost.
[in German] All good?
-[Capito] Yeah, all good.
-[Toto] Good.
[commentator 2 in English] <i>The drivers</i>

-[Ricciardo] It was good. I was in LA.
-I was in Mexico.
-[Ricciardo] It's summer there or winter?
-Yeah, it's always summer in Mexico!
-[both laugh]
-[Russell] Need to get the thermals out.

[Bottas] Hmm.
[Russell] They're motherfuckers.
Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it.
[Bottas] Hello.
How are you doing? Good?
-[reporter 1] How are you?
-How are you?
[reporter 2] Well, this is a joy.
-Both of you guys early.
-[Bottas] How are you?
-[Russell] Good. You?
-Good.
[reporter 3] Question to both of you.
Do you know yet
what you're doing next year?
[Bottas] Who's starting?
There's no news to share. [laughs]
I think it's the same for me and George,
that we have a job to do here,
and, um, there's no news,
and we're gonna focus on racing
and getting maximum points
for the teams we're racing in.
[reporter 3] Good luck
for the weekend. Thank you.
Uh, well, Valtteri said more than I said,
so, uh, maybe he knows something I don't.
Who knows, hey?
Seems like it'll pour it down.
-How you doing, Will?
-You okay?
-Very good. You?
-[Will] Yeah, good.
Here we are at Spa,
returned from the summer break,
still no news.
It suggests this is the last chance
for both drivers
to impress the guy
that you want to impress,
which is Toto Wolff.

[engine revving]
{\an8}[Russell] In the rain,
it's incredibly dangerous.
The drivers don't really know
where the perfect amount of grip is.
You've got to take more risks.
You put it all on the line,
but no risk, no reward,
and that's why I love it.
[commentator 1]
<i>Nine minutes of qualifying to go.</i>

{\an8}[Jego] Careful. Rejoin safely.
{\an8}[Riki] <i>So some aquaplaning reported</i>
<i>around turn eight.</i>
{\an8}[Bottas] I just nearly lost it
on the straight.
[Riki] <i>We need a tidy lap.</i>
[Toto] Spray makes
a big difference in perception.
-[Riki] <i>Come on, Valtteri, bring it.</i>
-[Bottas] I'm trying!
[commentator 1] <i>It looks so painfully slow</i>
<i>there for Valtteri Bottas,</i>
<i>but he daren't go much quicker.</i>
{\an8}[Riki] <i>We finished P8.</i>
{\an8}[Bottas] Fucking hell!
[dramatic musical flourish]
{\an8}[Russell] The rain is falling
harder and harder.
I think the track's gonna get worse.
{\an8}-Happy to go for slow then fast after?
<i>-</i>[Urwin] <i>Yeah.</i>
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 4] <i>Here comes Norris,</i>
<i>who's been so impressive today.</i>
{\an8}<i>No, he's lost it! It's a huge shunt.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Lando Norris</i>
<i>has had a big off.</i>
[Russell] Red flag. Red flag. Red flag.
{\an8}[Urwin] <i>Copy, copy, copy.</i>
<i>Norris has shunted.</i>
[Russell] Is he all right?
{\an8}[Joseph] <i>Lando, are you okay?</i>
{\an8}[Norris] Yeah. Fuck. Sorry, boys.
{\an8}[Urwin] <i>Yeah, Norris is okay.</i>
[tense music playing]
[cars zooming around track]
[commentator 4] <i>The track is now clear</i>
<i>and just two minutes of qualifying remain.</i>
[Russell] I think we need
to get the lap in and see what happens.
In that moment, it's all instinctive.
You're not thinking about anything.
You're just going as fast as you can.
You're so focused.
You know, the helmet's on.
Nothing else in the world matters.
You've just got one goal.
[commentator 1] <i>You see the spray</i>
<i>before the car.</i>
[tense music intensifies]
[commentator 1] <i>George Russell</i>
<i>now sets the fastest first sector.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Supreme skills</i>
<i>and bravery going on out here.</i>
<i>These are sketchy conditions.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Hang on a minute,</i>
<i>George Russell half a second quicker</i>
<i>than Lewis Hamilton, in a Williams!</i>
[Russell] You're really pushing the limit.
You're on the edge of the cliff.
One step more and you're off
and you're in the wall.
[commentator 1] <i>George Russell so far,</i>
<i>the star of qualifying.</i>
[Russell] When it comes together,
everything is sounded out,
you feel at one with the car,
that buzz is just like nothing else.
You feel electric, you feel alive.
Every corner,
one after another after another,
it's what you dream of as a racing driver.
[commentator 1] <i>Just get it</i>
<i>through the chicane, George,</i>
<i>straight-line it, get to the line,</i>
<i>and we'll see what happens after that.</i>
<i>Across the line goes George Russell.</i>
[Urwin] <i>George Russell.</i>
<i>-P2.</i>
-[Russell] Yes, guys!
[raucous cheering]
[commentator 1] <i>It's a front row</i>
<i>for George Russell in Spa</i>
<i>in a Williams!</i>
[Russell] Come on! Yes! Yes!
-Woo!
-[Urwin] <i>That's a stonking lap.</i>
<i>You've outqualified Mr. Hamilton.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>It's Williams'</i>
<i>first front row since Italy 2017.</i>
[Russell] Fucking hell, that was hard.
Amazing, guys, amazing.
Well done, everybody.
[Vowles] Quite impressive
in a Williams, you know.
[Toto] Well done, George.
[Capito] <i>That's fantastic, George.</i>
<i>You were outstanding.</i>
<i>Thanks so much.</i>
[crowd cheering]
[Capito] Hey! Hey, George. [chuckles]
Fantastic. How great is this, huh?
-Not bad, eh? [giggles]
-[Capito] No, good! [laughs]
[Capito] These are
the moments you live for.
George has the coolness
and the professionalism to get everything,
and this last lap was fantastic to see,
and I think this lap
will be a lap that made history.
[Buxton] George's lap at Spa
was phenomenal.
One of the best laps you'll ever see.
The risks that he had to take,
when to push, when to hold.
You were on it
the whole… whole session, man.
George showed in that moment
that when the chance comes,
he can be relied on.
[Toto] George did a fantastic job
in Bahrain with us
and, on several occasions this year,
has shown that he can outperform the car
and, against the odds, be right there,
and Spa has been one of those examples.
As a team, you need to look to the future.
You cannot just concentrate
on this very current championship.
Therefore, we need
to look at the next generation.
I made my decision.
[tense music playing]
-[Toto] Finally you've come.
-[Russell] All good?
-[Toto] We do this?
-Yeah.
[Toto] It's really difficult for us
because Valtteri has been
such an important part of the team
in making us win all these championships.
The bad news is
you're driving against Lewis.
The good news is you're in a Mercedes.
Welcome.
Thank you, seriously.
[Toto] Let's have dinner.
[emotional music playing]
At Mercedes, for me,
it wasn't meant to be,
to win probably the world title.
It's hard to accept.
I don't have a contract for next year.
As a driver, it's not ideal,
you know, when you don't know
what the future holds,
but that's the sport.
[tense music playing]
{\an8}[Buxton] There's only three races left.
It is getting extreme.
{\an8}Boiling over.
-This sport is brutal.
-[commentator]<i> Bottas in trouble.</i>
-[Horner] It's not a kids' club.
-[Toto] Winning in the right way…
[Lewis] He just brake tested me!
…is as important as winning.
Oh, shut up.
The guy has no fuckin' idea.
{\an8}[dramatic music playing]
{\an8}[Buxton] It's gonna be
the biggest race of a generation.
-[machinery whirring]
-[engine revving]
-Get him!
-Lewis is gonna get it.
It all points to one person.
Max Verstappen.
It's winner takes all.
[dramatic music playing][tense music playing]
[cars zooming]
[Wolff] This is a season like no other.
[commentator 1] <i>This is gonna be</i>
<i>Hamilton's chance!</i>
[crowd cheering]
[Horner] There has been just so much
of a cauldron of pressure.
[crunching]
[Horner] It's reached a level
I don't think anyone expected.
It's just been,
you know, insane.
Since Silverstone,
it's just gone up and up and up.
You can see it
bubbling over, boiling over.
[engine revving]
[commentator 2] <i>And there's Verstappen.</i>
<i>It's wheel to wheel!</i>
[Lewis] Max is kind of do or die.
It's like you're either crashing
or you're… or you're not going by.
[shocked gasping]
[Max] For me, the only thing
which matters is victory.
I want to become a world champion.
[clock ticking]
It's not just about me and Toto
or Max and Lewis.
[cheering]
[Horner] It's the whole team
that's competing as a team.
Going head-to-head.
-[machinery whirring]
-[engine revving]
[cars zooming]
[Max] That's what you get
when you don't leave space.
[Lewis] Oh, guys.
[Max] Fucking hell.
[Bono] <i>Switch off the engine,</i>
<i>please, Lewis.</i>
{\an8}I think he pushes it to the limit
and probably beyond.
I like to think
that I fight hard and fair.
I have a track record
of fighting hard and fair.
I don't have a track record
of crashing with people.
[commentator 2]
<i>They're gonna be talking about this</i>
<i>for a long, long time to come.</i>
<i>Two teams that aren't exactly</i>
<i>best of friends.</i>
He… he doesn't leave me the space.
[Horner] Neither driver wanted to concede
and the end result was what we saw.
[reporter 1] How do they avoid contact
going forward?
[Horner] We try and make sure he's ahead
on the circuit. That's the easiest way.
{\an8}[airplane engine idles]
{\an8}[man 1] Max was behind
all the way through the corner,
had no chance of making it,
launched the car over the curb into Lewis.
The tire fell on his head.
[man 1] Max has posted though,
on social, that he was squeezed.
-[Toto] I'm not interested.
-[man 1] I'm just saying--
[Toto] I'm not interested in
any social media posts. Irrelevant.
I think Monza was an ugly accident,
because you could see
the tire marks on the car.
{\an8}You don't want to even continue
that thought. What could have happened.
[man 1] "In the opinion of the stewards,
this maneuver was attempted too late
for the driver
to have the right to racing room,
and therefore find the driver of car 33
was predominantly to blame
for the incident."
[indistinct chatter over phone]
[in German] Max gets
a three-place grid penalty in Russia.
[man 2 on phone] <i>In the end,</i>
<i>you have to admit you were lucky.</i>
Yes, if you look at the recordings,
the wheel is on top of Lewis' helmet.
Uh… So, yes,
it could have ended really badly.
[man 2] <i>Was that an act</i>
<i>that came of desperation, you think?</i>
Yes, I mean, if you look at just the race,
Lewis has avoided the contact. Um…
Max knew if he didn't stay there,
the race was lost, so he stayed there.
[in English] When it was clear
that Lewis would probably come out ahead,
Max did
what was expected.
He just stopped him.
Ciao. Ciao, ciao.
[tense music playing]
[man 1] The car's been back today
to get everything stripped.
-So we've got Lewis's chassis.
-[Toto] Yeah.
[man 3] We're expecting damage
inside the structure.
[Toto] He was a lucky man.
[man 3] Oh yeah.
Just watch your hands. It's so sharp.
-[Toto] Yeah.
-[man 3] Anyone not in favor of the halo…
That was me, you know, four years ago.
I was fighting the halo.
And I was…
Thank God I didn't win that fight.
-[man 4] Have you seen Lewis's helmet?
-[Toto] Yeah.
-[man 4] Is it bad or…
-[Toto] It's damaged.
And you see tire marks.
Hopefully, it reminded everybody
this is one of the most dangerous
sports that exists.
And in a hard fight,
winning in the right way
is as important as winning.
-Thank you.
-[man 1] Thanks, Chris.
{\an8}The one thing with this season, I think,
is everybody was excited about the fight.
Everyone was excited about the challenge.
But it is getting extreme.
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton wins in Russia.</i>
[Bono] <i>Get in there, Lewis!</i>
<i>That's the 100.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Verstappen finishes second,</i>
<i>having started at the back of the grid.</i>
[Horner] Stay calm.
We will get the fuckers.
[commentator 2] <i>Everyone is now ready.</i>
[Buxton] There are two trophies,
two championships at stake.
One for the individual drivers,
and one for the teams.
And with both within reach,
everyone's pushing themselves
to the absolute limit.
[commentator 2] <i>It's a double podium</i>
<i>for Red Bull.</i>
[Lewis] Shit,
why did you give up that space?
Shouldn't have come in, man. I told you!
[Gow] There's hardly anything separating
the cars, the drivers, the teams.
[commentator 2] <i>For the first time</i>
<i>on US soil,</i>
<i>Max Verstappen wins the US Grand Prix!</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton has to settle for second.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>The tension</i>
<i>is building race after race.</i>
[reporter 2] I think tactical thinking
for the coming races--
-[Toto] Do you drink?
-[reporter 2] Is it bullshit?
Do you drink during the day?
-[reporter 2] No, no, no.
-You do.
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>Three abreast</i>
<i>at the moment. Into turn one we go.</i>
<i>Verstappen is into the lead,</i>
<i>ahead of Hamilton.</i>
[Horner] Come on!
[commentator 2] <i>Max Verstappen wins</i>
<i>the Mexico City Grand Prix!</i>
[Buxton] They have both had to mount
the most incredible challenges.
[chuckling] It's pretty exciting
to be fair.
[commentator 2] <i>Here goes Hamilton.</i>
<i>He's trying to take the lead</i>
<i>from Verstappen,</i>
<i>but he is forced wide by Verstappen!</i>
Fucking asshole!
[Max] I'm not sure
we can make this to the end.
[commentator 2]
<i>Hamilton pulls ahead of Verstappen.</i>
[cheering]
[commentator 2] <i>He has gone from last</i>
<i>all the way to first.</i>
[Lewis] Whoo! Yes! Come on, guys!
[fading crowd cheers]
And now there's only three races left.
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome to the desert.</i>
<i>We're in Qatar</i>
<i>for the first of this year's</i>
<i>brand-new circuits in the Middle East.</i>
[Toto] Morning.
[commentator 1 in English] <i>The battle</i>
<i>for the championships are heating up.</i>
[man] Apparently it hasn't rained
in this country for over a year.
-Over a year?
-[man] Yeah.
[Norris] Ciao. <i>Buongiorno. </i>[giggles]
-What's <i>"buongiorno?" </i>Good morning?
-[Sefton] Yeah.
-Oh.
-[Sefton] Or "hello."
-I said, "Ciao. <i>Buongiorno."</i>
-[Sefton] Who?
[Norris] To Mattia.
[Ricciardo chuckles] Yes!
Gasly!
[Gow] Qatar is a brand-new track
for Formula 1.
They're going into the unknown.
They don't have years of data to analyze.
It's gonna challenge every single team
{\an8}to the absolute maximum.
{\an8}It is difficult for the driver.
You need to get up to speed very fast.
[Steiner] Until we go on the race track,
nobody will know<i> </i>what is coming next.
{\an8}That risk element is involved.
Some people like this risk element.
{\an8}And I like it.
You know, it doesn't scare me.
{\an8}It's a new track. Will it suit us?
Will it suit Mercedes? We have no idea.
[Pérez] How long is the main straight?
Full throttle…
I think it's 1.2K full throttle.
-Fuck, it's long.
-Yeah.
[commentator 1] <i>With so much at stake,</i>
<i>how will this race affect</i>
<i>the drivers' title championship fight</i>
<i>between Verstappen and Hamilton?</i>
<i>But also for the teams.</i>
<i>They're battling for that lucrative</i>
<i>Constructors' Championship,</i>
<i>where Mercedes currently</i>
<i>have a narrow 11-point lead.</i>
With everything so tight,
everyone's gonna be trying
everything they can
to throw their rivals off.
The fight is very much on.
[machinery whirring]
[Toto] Can you reduce press
to the minimum level.
-Yes, no problem.
-[distant cars zooming]
[Toto] Let Christian do
all the press work. He enjoys that.
-[reporter 3] Bonjour.
-Bonjour.
[reporter 3] There seems to be
high tension between the drivers,
between the team principals.
Is it good for Formula 1 or is it a bit--
It's a competition, you know?
It's not a… It's not a kids club.
And, you know,
we operate in different ways.
Toto will shout and scream at the camera.
Maybe I'm a little bit more, um…
calm.
[Toto] Christian is a bit like
a Jack Russell Terrier
who likes to snap at your heels.
It is expected that every team principal
is gonna fight
for the benefit of his own team.
But whining
in the press is something that I have seen
on a new level this year.
[Horner] For the first time,
you've seen him under pressure.
He maybe feels
that I antagonize him a bit,
but that's part of the sport.
[distant cars zooming]
-[Toto] With whom am I in the conference?
-[man 1] Christian.
[Toto] Oh, that's fun. Huh!
-[man 2] I'll be watching that one.
-[Toto] Oh, that's fun.
[Horner] Do you reckon I should go
for a toasting or go gentle?
[woman] Let him crumble.
I could have him in a fight.
-Oh yeah.
-[Horner] I might be shorter, but I'm…
-[woman] A bit more nippity.
-[Horner] Exactly.
{\an8}I can completely understand Christian.
{\an8}You know, he's watched Toto winning
for so many years.
It's clear that that causes
a certain resentment, and…
that's competition.
You know, it can get tough.
It can get ugly.
[Horner] Right. Showtime.
[purposeful music playing]
[Toto] Where's the circus show?
-Where is the circus show?
-[man 3] At the end.
-[man 4] This is making all their weekend.
-[Horner] I know.
[man 4] It's like a ring walk.
-[Horner] What, sorry? Yeah.
-It's like a ring walk, like boxers.
[man 5] No scratching or biting,
all right?
Have fun!
[Toto] Okay.
[tense music playing]
[camera shutters clicking]
-[Horner] Good afternoon.
-[Toto] Good afternoon.
[host] Welcome to
the Friday press conference
ahead of the 2021
FIA Formula 1 Qatar Grand Prix.
As you can see, we're joined
by Toto Wolff and Christian Horner.
[reporter 4] How would you describe
relations at the moment
between Red Bull and, uh, Mercedes?
Would you say there's still mutual respect
as you fight these last few rounds?
[camera shutters clicking]
[host] Who'd like to start?
Christian, please.
[Horner] There is no relationship.
I don't need to kiss his arse
or anything like that.
You know, I think that would be
dishonest in… in… in many respects,
to fake a facade,
when, you know, you're…
you're competing against each other.
We're fighting for the World Championship
and the Constructors' Championship,
and, uh, we're gonna push to the maximum.
We've worked hard.
[host] Toto?
[Toto] It's clear that this is tough.
It's the World Championship
of the highest category in motor racing.
Um, and what started as Olympic boxing
went to pro boxing, and is now MMA.
We are in the ring there
and gloves are off.
[suspenseful music playing]
-[man 5] Some good lines that you got in.
-Yeah, good.
[Toto in German]
What's his thing with my ass?
I mean, my ass!
[Domenicali] Formula 1,
it's a big sporting fight.
{\an8}Everyone is trying to have
a tactical advantage.
So you… you try
to use psychological pressure
in order to… to… to win this fight.
[in German] The whole press conference
is so stupid.
The stuff he says, right?
[man 6] Let them talk into emptiness.
He's gonna talk, talk, talk.
Yeah. Talk, talk, talk.
[in English] Sport is brutal.
You need to be ruthless, competitive.
But I don't believe that to be successful
you need to be an asshole.
[machinery whirring]
[Buxton] The championship battle
is raging as much off the track
as it is on the track this year.
It's starting to become more of what can
be fought for and won in the shadows.
Sometimes, the best tool you have
is to protest your rival
to the governing body.
[notifications whistle]
[reporter] Is your suspicion
that the Mercedes rear wing
is somehow dumping drag?
Yes.
[Lewis] Are they testing my car?
They said that they'd pull my car in.
[man 7] They'll do normal checks.
Then there's another check that Red Bull
have sort of invented with the FIA.
-[Lewis] When? Today?
-[man 7] Uh… a couple of days ago.
It's not a regulatory check.
-[Lewis] What?
-[man 7] So it's not…
-Well--
-[Lewis] And we let them do that test?
That's fucking bullshit.
-[man 7] No, we will let them do it--
-[Lewis] Why?
[man 7] There's nothing wrong
with the wing.
[Gow] Teams are protesting
anything and everything.
It's driving standards,
it's the cars, the wings.
They're just throwing everything
at each other
to try and gain some sort of advantage.
[Lewis] That's bullshit that they can do
a test that we've not even tested for.
They're allowed to do it.
[man 7] The thing is, the last few races,
the gap we've had, that's car performance.
-Not--
-[Lewis] Yeah.
-[man 7] Here, we're the same on the--
-[Lewis] I've done a few good laps too.
-[man 7] I know you have.
-[all laugh]
-[Lewis] Never gives me credit.
-[man 7] I do.
-[Lewis] "That's all car performance."
-[man 7] No, I think…
[Buxton] You don't have
to win your protest,
but by getting their cars
torn to pieces, investigated,
your hope is
that you put them under pressure.
[suspenseful music playing]
[exhales sharply]
Brazil was just epic in so many…
Now there's all the cameras coming.
And just the response
has been just… incredible.
You… Sorry, guys… Are you guys…
-[mumbles indistinctly]
-[camera shutters clicking]
[Buxton] Lewis,
he's under constant scrutiny.
I think lot of people are waiting
for that moment when he trips up.
-[Lewis] Oh, shit!
-[man 8 yells]
-[Lewis] Are you okay?
-[man 8] Thank you.
-[Lewis] You all right? Yeah?
-[man 8] Yeah.
Can't imagine what it's like
to constantly have a camera in your face.
[Lewis] I feel like there's a time
and a place for cameras.
Give me a fucking second to answer these
and I'll pose for some shots.
[camera shutters clicking]
There's always been press focus
and press attention on Max,
but I don't think
it's as intrusive or constant.
-Like that?
-[Albon] Yeah. [laughs]
Or, like, tighter?
He's still the same guy that turned up
at the team as a 16-year-old.
-[Max] Back straight, like that?
-[Albon] Yeah.
[Albon coughs, laughs]
[Pérez] That looks weird, man.
What are you thinking of?
[all giggle]
This does look a bit weird.
[commentator 1] <i>It's time for qualifying</i>
<i>under the lights here in Qatar.</i>
<i>The battle for the two championships</i>
<i>ramping up,</i>
<i>and a crucial qualifying session ahead</i>
<i>as Mercedes battle Red Bull.</i>
-[Horner] Happy?
-[Max] Yeah.
[Horner] I think that downforce
is gonna work for you.
-Have fun.
-[Max] Yep.
[suspenseful music playing]
-[machinery whirring]
-[Lewis] Radio check.
[Bono] <i>Radio's loud and clear, Lewis.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Green light then</i>
<i>at the end of the pit lane.</i>
<i>The main contenders are getting ready.</i>
[engine revving]
[engine revving loudly]
[thrilling music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton will be the first</i>
<i>to start his flying lap.</i>
<i>Hamilton absolutely flying on this lap.</i>
<i>Only three poles</i>
<i>during the course of this season,</i>
<i>but have Mercedes</i>
<i>got the advantage tonight?</i>
<i>It is a 1:20.8 for Lewis Hamilton.</i>
[Bono] Okay, Lewis, let's just see
where the others come in.
[commentator 2] <i>Verstappen has to find</i>
<i>half a second on his final flying lap.</i>
{\an8}[Lambiase] <i>Look out for Gasly ahead.</i>
<i>He's just about to come past the pit wall.</i>
[Hamelin] <i>Okay, Pierre, Max behind you.</i>
{\an8}[Gasly] Okay.
-[commentators] Oh!
-[commentator 2] <i>Gasly has got a puncture!</i>
[Gasly] I lost the tire.
[Hamelin] <i>Stop by the pit exit.</i>
<i>Stop by the pit exit.</i>
[Gasly] I don't know
if it's safe to go there.
[Hamelin] <i>Okay, just stop</i>
<i>on the right-hand side. Stop on the right.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Where does he go here?</i>
<i>Gasly has had to stop on the circuit.</i>
<i>It could be very dangerous</i>
<i>for the other drivers still on track.</i>
{\an8}[Loos] <i>Uh, so the yellow flag</i>
<i>Gasly caused on the pit straight,</i>
<i>uh, I think that's made some people</i>
<i>abort their laps.</i>
[Buxton] Motorsport operates
on the basis of flags.
A double-waved yellow means there is a…
a pretty desperate potential danger ahead.
And in motor racing terms,
there is no excuse.
The double-waved yellow means
slow down and be prepared to stop.
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>Verstappen doesn't seem</i>
<i>to be slowing down here.</i>
{\an8}<i>Foot to the floor still,</i>
<i>trying to beat Hamilton's time.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Verstappen across the line.</i>
<i>It's second place for the Red Bull driver.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>That's a good effort.</i>
<i>That's, uh, P2. Front row.</i>
[Max] Oh, I tried.
[Horner] Well done, Max.
That's a good effort.
[Bono] That's P1, mate.
Four and a half tenths to Verstappen P2.
[Lewis] Yes! Let's go!
Great job, guys.
[tense music playing]
[Lewis] That was a double yellow there.
Did Max improve pace?
Interesting.
Ron?
Have you seen he's…
Have you seen he's improved
his sector… last sector on double yellow?
[Ron] Yeah. I've sent a note.
Did Max get a clean lap in at the end?
He had to back off the yellow flag.
No, there was no yellow flag there, no.
Is that a yellow or is that a white?
[Lewis] Shit! Double yellow.
It's not that easy
to see that yellow flag, but still.
Is that a penalty then?
[man 7] The thing is
it wasn't on the system.
[Lewis] Doesn't matter,
there's two yellow flags out.
[man 7] Yeah, you say that,
but they'll want Max on the front row, so…
[Lewis] You can't contest
a double yellow fucking flag. Come on.
[man 7] I know. Wait and see.
-Wait and see what happens.
-[Lewis] Yeah.
[tense music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen</i>
<i>is under investigation</i>
<i>and could receive a penalty</i>
<i>if the stewards believe…</i>
[commentator 3] <i>…possible double yellow</i>
<i>flag violation in qualifying yesterday.</i>
-[Horner] G'day.
-[Masi] Hello.
[Horner] Any news?
[Masi] Not… not as yet.
I'm going to have a bite to eat.
Is that good news or bad news, or…?
[Masi] I don't know. I think they're all
still writing and deliberating.
-Were you in the hearing?
-[Masi] No, I don't attend any hearings.
I've only ever…
I've only ever attended right of reviews.
So it sounds like a bit of a fuck-up, huh?
-[Masi] See what they come up with.
-Yeah, yeah. Okay.
[Masi] My role's multifaceted.
{\an8}It goes from friend, to, uh, umpire,
to policeman, to safety officer.
If teams see something
that, uh, may result in a penalty,
they bring that to my attention.
[woman] Oh my God.
[commentator 3] <i>The FIA</i>
<i>have just announced</i>
<i>Max Verstappen will have to drop</i>
<i>five places on the starting grid.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Because of that infraction</i>
<i>yesterday in qualifying.</i>
-[woman] Five places.
-[man 8 exhales sharply]
-[woman] Flipping heck.
-[man 8 laughs]
[Horner] What they saying for Max?
[Jos] It says, I think, five places.
[Coulthard] You're fucking joking?
That is fucking ridiculous.
-[Horner] And it's their fuck-up.
-[Jos] It's their fuck-up.
This outcome could, you know,
dictate the outcome certainly of this race
and therefore suddenly we go from having
a strong chance at the World Championship
to being odds against rather than odds on.
[commentator 2] <i>Welcome along</i>
<i>to the Losail International Circuit.</i>
It's the first-ever World Championship
Qatar Grand Prix.
[commentator 1] <i>This race could be key</i>
<i>in Red Bull and Mercedes' chances</i>
<i>of winning both championships.</i>
You know, we're gonna throw everything
at it, and, uh, we never give up.
[commentator 3] <i>Mercedes are 11 points</i>
<i>ahead in the Constructors' Championship.</i>
<i>After that grid penalty, Max is starting</i>
<i>the race way back in seventh.</i>
<i>So if Bottas and Hamilton</i>
<i>can put in good performances,</i>
<i>Mercedes could put one hand</i>
<i>on that constructors' title.</i>
[Bottas] It definitely takes two drivers
to win the constructors',
{\an8}and some people might think,
"Okay, he's leaving. He doesn't care,"
{\an8}but actually I… I do,
and, uh, I'm doing everything I can
to make that happen.
[tense music playing]
{\an8}[engine revving]
[commentator 2] <i>It's lights out</i>
<i>and away we go,</i>
<i>and it's a good start for Hamilton.</i>
[dramatic music playing]
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Verstappen on the inside</i>
<i>has made a brilliant start,</i>
{\an8}<i>but then goes off the track</i>
<i>and Fernando Alonso closes the door.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 1]
<i>Eleventh is Valtteri Bottas.</i>
<i>He's lost five places at the start.</i>
<i>Horrible first lap for Bottas.</i>
[Toto] What happened
with Valtteri at the start?
<i>Come on, Valtteri, get these cars.</i>
[Bottas] Yep, I am.
[Lambiase] <i>DRS now enabled.</i>
[Max] Yeah.
[commentator 1] <i>Here comes Verstappen.</i>
<i>He breezes past the AlphaTauri of Gasly.</i>
[Lambiase] Hamilton will start
to push a bit more now.
{\an8}[Bono] <i>Gap to Alonso, 4.1.</i>
{\an8}<i>Verstappen right behind him.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Max Verstappen has gone</i>
<i>from fourth to second.</i>
<i>It's Hamilton who leads,</i>
<i>and it's four seconds the gap.</i>
[Bono] <i>Verstappen now the car behind. 4.4.</i>
<i>So we need to at least maintain this gap.</i>
[Lewis] Understood.
Where's Valtteri?
[commentator 3] <i>Bottas is in fourth,</i>
<i>but he's really struggling on these tires.</i>
[Bottas] Check for punctures.
Not sure. It feels a bit weird.
I have a puncture.
[commentator 1] <i>Bottas is in the gravel!</i>
<i>That's not what Mercedes want at all.</i>
<i>Every point counts</i>
<i>in the constructors' title fight.</i>
[groaning]
[man 9] Shit!
{\an8}[commentator 1]<i> Bottas is in big trouble.</i>
<i>There's sparks flying everywhere.</i>
[Riki] Box. Box, box.
<i>We'll retire the car. Cool the car.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Valtteri Bottas</i>
<i>is retiring from this race.</i>
[Bottas] Yep.
Normal day for me in the office.
Thanks, guys, anyway.
-It's a massive loss in the constructors'.
-[man 10] Yep.
[commentator 3] <i>Lewis Hamilton first,</i>
<i>Max Verstappen second,</i> <i>Pérez in fourth,</i>
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>
<i>Red Bull have turned up the heat</i>
<i>in the Constructors' Championship.</i>
{\an8}[Pérez] Is this pace okay?
[Bird] <i>Yeah, this pace is good.</i>
[thrilling music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>across the line</i>
<i>and wins the first-ever Qatar Grand Prix.</i>
Yes! Come on!
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen</i>
<i>started seventh,</i>
<i>but he comes across the line</i>
<i>to finish second.</i>
[Horner] Well done, mate. That was
damage limitation and a great recovery.
[Max] Yeah, that was fun.
[commentator 3] <i>Pérez clinches fourth.</i>
<i>And with two races left,</i>
<i>the gap between Mercedes and Red Bull</i>
<i>has now dropped to just five points.</i>
[Bottas] So much bad luck.
At some point, it started to feel
almost like a bit of a joke.
[Toto] That's a typically hell day
in the office, right? [chuckles]
-[Bottas] Yeah.
-[Toto] Doesn't… doesn't get any worse.
[Toto chuckles]
All good. All good.
[melodic instrumental playing]
-[Bottas] Hello.
-Hey.
-[Bottas] How are you? Good.
-[Toto] Good. And you?
[Bottas] Shoes on, off?
[Toto] If they are dirty,
like they look, yes, off.
-[Bottas laughs]
-I'll take mine off also out of loyalty.
[Toto] I've great respect
and admiration for Valtteri.
It is tremendously difficult
to motivate yourself
when you know
you're on your way out from the team.
It's difficult to cope.
[Toto] Valtteri,
what do you want to drink?
The most expensive wine you have.
-[Toto] Before lunch already?
-[laughs] No, no. Joking.
-Well, I think--
-Sparkling water, please.
-Do you want some candles for candlelight?
-[Bottas] Yeah, sure. Roses.
Thank you.
[Toto] He has been an integral part
of the team and the team's success.
And we will miss him.
It was such a difficult decision,
to be honest.
I wrestled with myself for a long time.
Because, uh, your role in the team
is fundamental.
That is what… what made us
win all these championships.
Mm. Of course I know it's been
amazing to be with Mercedes
and all the results we've made,
but at the same time also,
it… it's consuming.
Five years of trying
to beat Lewis… [laughs]
…you know, it's not easy,
but I think, for me, personally, it's…
it's the right time
for something different.
A different challenge
can be quite freeing.
-It's actually quite sad to leave.
-[Toto] Yeah.
But at the same time,
I think now is the right time for me.
I've given everything and, um…
-And I will for the remaining races.
-Yeah.
[Bottas] It would mean a lot to me
to kind of leave on a high.
To win five constructors' titles
together with the team
would be a big achievement already.
When I can't win the… win the title,
I want Lewis to win it.
So, I… I hope both of those things happen.
It would be, for me,
like, the perfect ending
of… of this… this era of… of my career.
Valtteri, I will be
always cheering for you.
Let's go for the constructor.
This is what we want. Two races to go.
Two times fun.

we've got two races to go.
And we've got our first match point.
[chuckling] We can absolutely win
both championships.
If things fall right,
it could happen this weekend.
[tense music playing]
[Toto] This is exactly where
we operate well.
I love the Saudi track.
It's fast, it's dangerous.
It is a track where you have
to put your balls on the dashboard.
[tense music playing]
[commentator 2]
<i>Welcome to what is sure to be</i>
<i>a very exciting qualifying session.</i>
<i>We've got to decide</i>

{\an8}[Ocon] Balance is okay so far.
[Adami] <i>Track is clear. You can push.</i>

-[Max] I don't know.
[Horner] You got that dizziness again?
You've been drinking okay?
You're… you're hydrated?
-[Max] Yeah.
-[Horner] Think it's the lights?
[Max] Yeah, I dunno. Maybe.
-I don't need to throw up, but--
-[Horner] You just feel a bit… Yeah.
We'll get John to have a good look.
We've got an opportunity
to win this championship,
but Max is feeling really unwell.
You know, particularly with where we are
in the championship, it's a big concern.

-[Bono]<i> A-firm. Next lap, pushing.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Here comes Hamilton.</i>
<i>That's a rapid lap from Hamilton.</i>
<i>Provisional pole.</i>
<i>Now all eyes on Red Bull.</i>
[chuckling] The one place you don't want
to feel bad is in a Formula 1 car,
particularly on a street circuit
the speed of which, you know, Saudi is.
[engine revving]
[Lambiase] <i>Track is clear ahead of you.</i>
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>What has Verstappen got</i>
<i>in answer to Lewis Hamilton?</i>
<i>Oh, did he touch the wall?</i>
<i>He got perilously close to it there,</i>
<i>Max Verstappen.</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>Verstappen and Red Bull know</i>
<i>how important pole would be</i>
<i>for both championships.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>Purple sector 1.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>That's the fastest</i>
<i>first sector time we've had so far.</i>
<i>Verstappen, absolutely flying</i>
<i>and can spoil the Mercedes party</i>

[Max] Fucking hell.
[Lambiase] <i>All okay, Max?</i>
-[Max] Yeah.
<i>-</i>[Lambiase] <i>Okay, mate?</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen will have</i>
<i>to settle for third.</i>
<i>Bottas will be second on the grid,</i>
<i>Hamilton first. A Mercedes front row.</i>
<i>That could be huge</i>
<i>for the Constructors' Championship.</i>
[Bono] <i>Well, that's just the most hectic</i>
<i>Q3 we've had in a long time.</i>
So, yeah, P1. Valtteri, P2.
-[Lewis] You had me worried for a second.
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Verstappen was on for a good one.</i>
<i>He really was on a flier, but, uh, yeah.</i>
<i>Nice job for, uh, keeping it cool.</i>
[Jos] You think it's a good idea
to have a look?
[Horner] Yes, I do, yeah.
I think we need to check everything.
{\an8}Maybe look at the visor
'cause I don't know about the light.
{\an8}Maybe we go darker
on the visor or… I dunno.
{\an8}Could be. Yep. We, uh…
[Horner] Yeah, but we need
to get it fully checked over.
Brutal. Four tenths, huh?
I mean, it would've been a proper lap.
It really would.
He'd have been, uh…
He'd have been on pole.
[Buxton] The question mark now,
after that lap,
is how much damage has been done.
In the race, there's no margin for error.
No room for mistakes.
It's gonna be great.

<i>on the Mercedes drivers</i>
<i>as the battle</i>
<i>for the Constructors' Championship</i>
<i>comes to a head.</i>
<i>Will they be able</i>
<i>to clinch it this weekend?</i>
[Bottas] The luck really hasn't been
on my side with Mercedes.
Maybe it just wasn't meant to be.
My role is now helping
winning the Constructors' Championship.
And you do need two drivers for that.
I'll be racing until the very end.
{\an8}We want… Red Bull,
we want our team to… to win everything.
Hopefully, I can do something to help Max.
[Max] You really want to be out there,
battling, like, lap by lap,
trying to overtake,
maybe a bit of wheel banging.
That, for me,
feels like a… a proper battle.
[Lambiase] <i>Radio check, Max.</i>
[Max] Yep, radio check.

<i>and stick on a fresh set of tires?</i>
[siren wails]
{\an8}-[Lewis] So we're pitting?
-[Bono] <i>A-firm. Box, box.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton pits.</i>
<i>From the race lead, the Mercedes is in.</i>
[machinery whirring]

[Max] Can the safety car go faster?
We're driving 100.
[Lambiase] <i>Red flag, Max. Red flag.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>The marshals are waving</i>
<i>the red flag. The race is being suspended.</i>
<i>This really changes things.</i>
-[Max] That means we are in the lead, no?
<i>-</i>[Lambiase] <i>That's correct.</i>
[commentator 3] <i>Under a red flag,</i>
<i>Verstappen is allowed</i>

<i>Hamilton has given that first place away</i>

[Lewis] That's bullshit.
[Bono] There's still possibilities for us.

{\an8}<i>Verstappen and Hamilton,</i>

<i>and Hamilton goes into the first corner.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen sends him</i>
<i>to the outside.</i>
<i>He's off the circuit. He's back in front!</i>
[Lewis] He cut across the whole curb.
[Bono] Roger, Lewis. Yeah. We're on it.

<i>Can you get going?</i>
[Pérez] I can't, man.

[Bird] <i>Okay, stop the car. Stop the car.</i>
[Max] These standing starts
are insanely dangerous.
[commentator 3] <i>As the debris</i>
<i>is cleared up,</i>
<i>we've heard</i>
<i>officials are gonna have another look</i>
<i>at that overtake by Verstappen.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>This could change things</i>
<i>all over again.</i>
-[Horner] Hi, Michael.
-[Masi] Hi.
I'm going to drop you back behind Hamilton
based on what occurred at turn one, two.
[Horner] They're gonna make him start P3
behind Ocon and Hamilton.
[Marko] It's ridiculous.
[commentator 2] <i>Prepare then</i>
<i>for the third start of the evening.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>We will have Ocon</i>
<i>in pole position, Hamilton in second,</i>
<i>and Max Verstappen lining up in third.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Have you ever known</i>
<i>a race like this?</i>
[Bono] <i>And, Lewis, on the restart,</i>
<i>you can use strat five or seven</i>
<i>and overtake where appropriate.</i>

<i>Verstappen in the lead, Hamilton second.</i>
[Bono] <i>Gap at 1.4.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Lewis Hamilton is gaining,</i>
<i>and he is gaining on Max Verstappen.</i>
[Bono] Lewis, push and overtake.

[commentator 2] <i>He's going for the move.</i>
<i>They go wheel to wheel!</i>
<i>They almost collided once again!</i>
[commentator 1]
<i>And Verstappen's off track again!</i>
<i>Hamilton avoids the collision.</i>

<i>Verstappen keeps the lead of the race.</i>
Michael. This is Toto, Michael.
[Masi] Toto, just give me a second.
[Lewis] That guy is fucking crazy.
[Bono] <i>Yeah, copy that, Lewis.</i>
<i>We're on it.</i>
[Masi] I'm going to ask Max
to give that position up.
[Horner] We felt we were pushed off there.
{\an8}[Lambiase] <i>Max, let's give the position</i>
<i>back to Hamilton.</i>
<i>Do that strategically.</i>
No! Unbelievable!
-Fuck! Fuck!
-[indistinct yelling]
-[man 1 groaning] Oh my God!
-[man 2] Come on!
[Lewis] He just brake tested me.
I've just hit him, man. My wing's broken.

<i>Verstappen got on the brakes.</i>

<i>to lead this race,</i>
<i>but that incident is under investigation</i>
<i>by the stewards.</i>

[commentator 2] <i>Lap 43,</i>
<i>Hamilton now leads from Max Verstappen!</i>
[dramatic music playing]
[commentator 1] <i>Further back,</i>
<i>Valtteri Bottas is also pushing.</i>
Bottas to the outside of Ricciardo
into turn one, and into fourth place.
[Riki] <i>Next, Ocon. Ahead is Ocon.</i>
{\an8}[Peckett] Okay, mate, let's keep
that pace up. Bottas, 1.6 behind.
[crowd cheering]
[commentator 3] <i>But this race isn't over.</i>
{\an8}[Riki] <i>You got one more lap.</i>
<i>Don't back off.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>If Bottas</i>
<i>can beat Ocon to third,</i>
<i>the Constructors' Championship</i>
<i>could be as good as Mercedes'.</i>
<i>It all comes down to this last half a lap.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Esteban Ocon trying</i>
<i>to hold on for a podium.</i>
<i>Bottas is trying to snatch it off him.</i>
[Riki] <i>Come on, Valtteri, you got this.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Out of the final corner,</i>
<i>towards the checkered flag.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Racing to the line.</i>
<i>Bottas has got Ocon right at the line!</i>
-[Ocon] No! For fuck's sake.
-[Peckett] <i>Sorry, mate.</i>
[cheering]
[Bottas] Yeah! We got it! Ha!
[cheering]
[Lambiase] <i>Hard luck with that.</i>
[Max] It is what it is, mate.
[chuckles] <i>I tried at least.</i>
[Bono] <i>Get in there, Lewis.</i>
<i>That has got to be</i>
<i>the craziest race I remember.</i>
[Lewis] That's more like it. Come on.
[commentator 3] <i>A truly dramatic race,</i>
<i>and the result for Mercedes</i>
<i>means they have</i> <i>one hand</i>
<i>on the Constructors' Championship trophy</i>
<i>for a record eighth time in a row.</i>
[whirring]
He did his best, huh.
[Jos] He did everything that was possible,
but then he let him through,
then he drives in the back of him.
Well, we're gonna a go at that,
because, you know,
Max is under investigation for it,
but it's fucking Hamilton that--
-He lifted off to let him pass.
-Yeah.
[cheering]
We've won eight consecutive
World Championships.
That wasn't done in any other sport.
[indistinct announcement]
[Toto] We started the season
very much on the back foot,
but we managed to crawl back.
What the team has achieved
makes me incredibly proud.
What me and Lewis have been able
to achieve as teammates
I think could be best team
in the history of Formula 1 maybe,
so, um, it's pretty special.
The team are not there to win
a championship for one person,
but to win the championship as a whole.
Valtteri has just been a great teammate.
You know, it's been a privilege
to work with someone like that.
[commentator 1] <i>There's only one race left</i>
<i>and the drivers' title is all to play for.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen</i>
<i>are level on points.</i>
<i>Only one can become world champion</i>
<i>and it will be decided in the final race</i>
<i>of the season in Abu Dhabi.</i>
[Horner] They got what they wanted.
It goes to the final race.
Next weekend.
We'll get the fuckers next weekend.
To have won the amount of races
that we have, if we don't come away
with the Drivers' Championship,
how do you pick yourself up after that?
We've got to do everything we can
to… to get this over the line.
[Toto] Two drivers
that come into the last race
with 396 and a half points.
Lewis is driving exceptionally,
and ultimately, the stopwatch never lies.
The quicker guy
is gonna win the championship.
You know what?
Hang on, let's see what Toto's saying.
<i>Out of nowhere…</i>
Oh, shut up.
Fucking idiot.
The guy has no fucking idea.
{\an8}[commentator 2] <i>Welcome along</i>
<i>to the final round of this 2021 season.</i>
[Horner] It's been a hell of a journey.
[commentator 3] <i>Max versus Lewis.</i>
[Max] The world champion
against the young gun. A proper battle.
[Lewis] I've fought hard
for this World Championship.
You can imagine
the emotions are running high.
-No!
-Come on!
[commentator 2] <i>Is it gonna be</i>
<i>a first World Championship for Verstappen?</i>
<i>Is it gonna be an eighth</i>
<i>World Championship for Lewis Hamilton?</i>
[dramatic music playing]At least we're almost at the end.
Have you fallen asleep there?
Yeah, I know.
-[producer] No. It was very good.
-"Very good, yeah."
[producer] Best yet.
Save the best till last.
-[producer] Right.
-Testing, three, four.
Nutsack, five, six.
Action.
[upbeat dance music playing]
[shutters clicking]
-[Ricciardo] Ciao. <i>Buongiorno.</i>
-[photographer] <i>Grazie. Grazie!</i>
{\an8}Happy for me to do this with no shoes on?
{\an8}I've not had my laundry back since Saudi.
I have no socks.
[man] Morning.
-[Mattia in Italian] Trendy T-shirt.
-[Leclerc] You bet!
It's Ferrari.
[in English] I feel like
I have something in my teeth.
Hope I've nothing in my teeth.
You never know. You have a bit
of, like, carrot here from… from lunch.
[shutter clicking]
[Gasly] Now, you can't talk dirty to me,
because they're recording everything.
-They love this content.
-[woman giggles]
[Gasly] But they don't pay enough
to get it though.
{\an8}Has been just insane.
{\an8}I… I can't remember
a season which was more exciting
than the one we are seeing this year.
[man] <i>Muchas gracias.</i>
[Russell] Danny.
Do you wanna swap helmets?
-We haven't, have we?
-[Russell] Shall we?
I was gonna wait for your Mercedes one.
Will that be cooler?
{\an8}It's sad to be leaving Williams,
but I can't wait
to go to Mercedes next year.
I just want to win.
-[Sefton] Put your mask on, please.
-No.
[Sefton] Why not?
-'Cause I do what I want when I want.
-[Sefton] Right.
-That's quite a lot of sass.
-[chuckles]
[Norris] I did 100% better
than the previous year.
{\an8}My best highlight is the one-two in Monza.
You can probably just cut to Daniel
saying exactly the same thing.
{\an8}[producer] What's your highlight
of the season?
{\an8}Monaco.
LOL.
Yeah, it was definitely Monza.
Ultimately, we want to be
winning more races.
More of those Monza feels.
It's what dreams are made of.
-[man 1] You got a little souvenir there.
-[woman] Oh my God, that's so funny.
-[Brown] Hurt.
-[woman] Did it?
[Brown] I'm not doing that again.
{\an8}That was the longest 53 laps of my life.
It was awesome.
[man 2] This is a group one, so…
{\an8}[frustrated sigh]
It was a tough year.
Very difficult to have highlights.
It's looking to the future.
That's what keeps me going.
[Mazepin] Yesterday,
a girl came up to me, she was like,
"Can you please crash into Lewis for me?"
And she's English!
[Buxton] If you'd asked me mid-season
would we be going into the final race
of the year level on points?
No way.
Unbelievable.
[producer 1] Who's your money on?
I've gone back and forth.
At this rate, it's a flip of a coin.
I think Lewis is gonna get it.
I think it all points to one person.
Max Verstappen.
Lewis and Max won't see the second corner.
[producer 2] Who's gonna win?
{\an8}-Political answer will be Formula 1.
-[camera shutters clicking]
{\an8}You know, someone is gonna walk away
from this being absolutely devastated.
The other is a worthy world champion.
It's gonna be
the biggest race of a generation.
{\an8}All of us drivers, we grew up with dreams
of winning a World Championship.
[distant squealing, applause]
[Lewis] Even after winning seven,
I still have that desire to wanna win.
[Max] I don't mind a battle, you know.
I started with this
when I was three, four years old.
{\an8}Just very determined to win,
{\an8}and I just have to make sure
that I'm the best at what I have to do.
{\an8}There's a lot at stake
for this last race of the season.
At the end, it all comes down to this.
We will be fighting
with everything we have.
The best man will prevail.
[Horner] It's been a hell of a journey.
{\an8}Abu Dhabi is everything
that we've fought for.
You only get one shot at it.
And if we don't convert it now,
we've only got ourselves to blame.
It's winner takes all.
[machinery whirring]
-[tires squealing]
-[engine revving]
[tense music playing]
-[commentator 1] <i>Now it gets serious.</i>
-[crowd cheering]
[commentator 1] <i>Welcome along</i>
<i>to the final round of this 2021 season.</i>
<i>-And it's time for qualifying.</i>
-[machinery whirring]
{\an8}[Brown] Come on, Mom.
You're coming on the grid with us.
{\an8}[Cisca] Thanks, Zak.
-[fan in distance] Lando!
-[Brown] Lando!
[crowd cheering]
-[Adam] He just walked straight past you.
-[Cisca] Yeah, okay.
[commentator 1] <i>The Drivers' Championship</i>
<i>is tied on points</i>
<i>heading into the final race.</i>
<i>When scores are level,</i>
<i>when the battle is that tight,</i>
<i>any advantage's gotta be a good advantage.</i>
[rhythmic thudding]
[Horner] Every time we've touched
their car, we've had a penalty.
Every time they've touched our car,
they've had… they've had no penalty.
They've had no penalty.
Abu Dhabi's a track that historically
has been very strong for Mercedes.
We need to throw everything at qualifying.
You know, you can imagine
the emotions are running incredibly high,
because it's now or never.
Get in there, enjoy it.
-Yeah.
-[Horner] Get stuck in.
Don't worry, I'll squeeze
Toto's bollocks this afternoon.
-[Max] Yeah. Exactly.
-[Horner] Of course.
-[Max] They like… They like all the drama.
-[Horner] They love it.
-But as soon as actually we are racing--
-[Horner] Then they don't like it.
[Max] So it's unbelievable.
[Toto] Christian does his job well,
and I think part of the job is to have
these little war games between us.
But it's racing. It's not politics.
Now it's just about
driving.
[suspenseful music playing]
[commentator 2] <i>It's time for qualifying</i>
<i>for the final race of the 2021 season.</i>
{\an8}[Latifi] As Jost would say,
"Let's go racing!"
[commentator 1] <i>George Russell</i>
<i>at his last race as a Williams driver.</i>
{\an8}[Adami] <i>Track is clear. You can push.</i>
<i>P5. P5. Good job.</i>
[Sainz] Very solid.
{\an8}[Tsunoda] Let's fucking go, man!
[commentator 2] <i>Rookie Tsunoda's</i>
<i>on a flying lap.</i>
[Spini] <i>It's P8. P8, Yuki.</i>
[Tsunoda] Oh, that was a fucking good lap.
{\an8}[Joseph] <i>Okay, Lando,</i>
<i>you are on the limit.</i>
P3. Great job.
[Norris] Yeah, baby! Woohoo!
[commentator 3] <i>End of qualifying hour.</i>
<i>Here we go then.</i>
<i>The moment you've been waiting for.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>We're into the final</i>
<i>shoot-out for pole position here.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton.</i>
<i>Max Verstappen.</i>
[engine revving]
[crowd cheering]
[Bono] <i>Okay, Lewis. Strat mode two</i>
<i>and you're good to go.</i>
[Lewis] Last sector any better?
[Bono] <i>A-firm. Uh, just the final corner.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Let's see what lap time</i>
<i>Hamilton can produce.</i>
[Bono] <i>Okay, Lewis, so yeah, that's P1.</i>
-[crew members] Yeah! Come on!
-[applause]
[commentator 3]
<i>This is looking good for Mercedes.</i>
<i>Now let's see what the Red Bulls can do.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>Okay, Max,</i>
<i>so Hamilton has gone.</i>
<i>That put you P2.</i>
<i>Four thousandths behind.</i>
[Max] Fuck!
[Lambiase] <i>Do whatever you need to here.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>
[Buxton] It's important
to remember in Formula 1,
it's all about the fine margins.
You take pole
by one thousandth of a second,
that pole could end up
being the difference
between the championship and second place.
[commentator 3] <i>Max Verstappen sets</i>
<i>the fastest time. He's on pole!</i>
<i>-</i>[Lambiase] <i>That's pole position.</i>
<i>-</i>[Max] Oh yes!
[raucous cheering]
Well done, mate. Great teamwork.
Great teamwork. Well done. Good job.
[Max] Fucking hell, I didn't expect
that one, but amazing job, guys. [laughs]
{\an8}[Bono] <i>Okay, Lewis.</i>
<i>That's P2. Verstappen P1.</i>
[raucous cheering]
[commentator 2] <i>This gives Verstappen</i>
<i>a huge advantage for tomorrow's race.</i>
[crew member laughs] I'm speechless.
[whooping]
[Jos] Unbelievable that. What a lap.
[Toto] We are ruthless and transparent
in the analysis of our own performances.
Uh, green is us.
Uh, purple is, uh, Verstappen.
Very quickly, we know
why we haven't performed well.
I think if you understand,
um, why you fell short
of your own expectations,
you can move on
and try to improve for the next race.
We didn't have the pace.
I don't want people
celebrating like we've won yet.
-[man 1] No, absolutely.
-[Horner] It's one piece of the jigsaw.
He's got to run his fastest race.
[crowd chanting] Maxi! Maxi! Maxi! Maxi!
Maxi! Maxi! [whooping]
Yuki, you are flying, man.
[laughs] I was fighting too much
in the last sector.
You look like you found the rhythm, huh?
-How was you?
-Not bad.
-The whole quali, you were quick.
-Yeah, it was good.
-[man 2] Can we go to Lee next?
-[man 3] Toto, you can do it tomorrow!
-[woman] Yeah!
-You can do it tomorrow!
[woman] You're the champion!
[reporter 1] In terms of the atmosphere
in the team, are they a little stunned?
Was Lewis a little bit stunned after that?
[Toto] I haven't seen him yet,
but, uh, definitely, in the team,
there was a bit of disappointment,
which is clear.
The… the tension is building.
The tension is building, um, definitely.
So 1-0 for them today.
[reporter 2] Max, congratulations.
Please describe your feelings.
[Max] Ah, it's been a really good day,
but I know the points are tomorrow, so…
We really have to, uh, be on it
and… and perform tomorrow as well.
[reporter 2] Thank you, Max.
[reporter 3] Starting alongside Max,
it's a wheel-to-wheel battle between you.
Um… I mean,
I'm grateful I can see the guy.
I mean, of course I'd love to have started
on… on, uh, uh, first.
But, uh, I did everything I could.
I did as good a lap as I could. Um…
I hope that I can at least keep up
with… with the pace that… that they have,
and… and hopefully,
we can work on strategy.
[reporter 3] Okay. Good luck.
I'm still optimistic,
although everyone's a little bit…
I think we're… we are better
coming from the back for the fight.
[man] What we have to do
is wind him up a bit.
-You want Lewis a bit fired up.
-[Susie] Yeah.
[man] As it is, he's been beat,
which he doesn't like.
-You want him beat and angry.
-[Susie] Yeah, I agree.
[man] See if you can find a way to…
[clicks tongue]
{\an8}What I find incredible with Lewis is
how deep he can dig
in these difficult moments.
And the level of performance
that he can bring to the table.
Lewis starting P2 certainly doesn't
put him in an advantageous situation,
but it is just what Lewis needs.
He's gonna push all race
in order to win it on track.
[shutter clicks]
[woman] Okay. I think
Yuki was not in the picture.
-[laughter]
-[Pérez] It's okay.
-[woman] No, you were not in the picture.
-[Tsunoda] No? [laughs]
[Horner] Know what I found out
this morning? Know they call him Checo?
-You know what it means in Mexico?
-[Tsunoda] No.
Big dick.
-[all] Aah!
-[laughter]
[Tsunoda] Really?
[Horner] This driver pairing,
this is as good as there is
up and down the pit lane.
I think Checo, with his experience,
is exactly what we needed.
For us, Checo is just finding his form
at the right time.
-Will you go flat out?
-Yeah. Well--
[Pérez] And, uh, driving to the one stop.
I feel, in the beginning,
of course, how the tires will be,
but then after that,
if you don't feel great, you have to go.
You cannot just sit there and be slow
because then they will try to get you.
[Horner] I think, you know,
in Max, we've got a driver
that is probably
the only driver on the grid
capable of… of taking on Lewis Hamilton.
Uh, where to start?
I mean, in our DNA we want to win.
You know,
anything is possible in… in this world
when you work very hard
and you keep pushing,
and look where we are now, this year.
We are in this final race
and now, of course,
we want to finish this off in… in style.
[whooping]
[Horner] Everybody's got
something to eat in them.
Yeah, I want to get the drivers to bed.
-Just need to keep them all calm tonight.
-Sorry?
[Horner] Keep them all calm,
focused on the race.
Yeah, we can do it.
-We have to beat them.
-[Horner] Yeah, yeah.
[man] Yo. Hey, Checo.
Hey, man. How's the hangover?
[man] No hangover, man. Just water for me.
[commentator 2] <i>Welcome to Abu Dhabi.</i>
<i>We are just hours away from the final race</i>
<i>in one of the most phenomenal seasons</i>
<i>Formula 1 has ever seen.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>The chance</i>
<i>for Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>to be the writer of their own story.</i>
<i>What we don't know</i>
<i>is how this blockbuster ends.</i>
[Toto] As a team principal,
it couldn't be more exciting.
I love the pressure.
This is when I'm in my comfort zone.
-How's Lewis? In good shape?
-[Toto] Good.
[man] Good.
He'll be looking forward to it.
Yeah, he's… he's absolutely in the zone.
I'm always trying to perform
to meet my own expectations.
You're either good enough or not.
[Horner] I feel the nerves.
I absolutely feel the nerves.
And, of course, moment that you know
is being watched
by close to a billion people.
All eyes are on, you know,
what's gonna happen at this race.
Who's gonna be world champion?
[tense music playing]
[machinery clunking]
Okay, an important question for you.
What do you want for Christmas?
[Olivia] <i>LPS! LPS!</i>
[Horner] All right.
[Toto in German] Hey, little man.
<i>-</i>[boy] <i>Hello.</i>
-[Toto] I'm sending you a kiss, okay?
<i>-</i>[boy in English] <i>Okay. Love you.</i>
-[Toto] Love you.
[in German] Kiss.
[Buxton in English] Christian and Toto,
they have very different styles,
but they're more similar than they…
than they would ever care to admit.
[Horner] Who do you think is gonna win
the World Championship this year?
<i>-</i>[Olivia] <i>Max.</i>
<i>-</i>Do you think he's got a chance?
<i>Yeah.</i>
[Buxton] You could not sacrifice
as much of your life<i> </i>to a job
if it didn't permeate
every single piece of your being.
It is life.
For Christian and for Toto,
it's everything.
{\an8}-How are you feeling?
-Yeah, good.
{\an8}-Yeah?
-Good. Just want… [sighs]
-The hanging around drives you mad.
-It's normal to feel nervous though.
Whatever your… your gut…
You've got a really good gut.
Follow it.
[Horner] Yep. Anyway, we'll see.
It'll be all right.
Right.
-[Geri] Are you going then? This is it?
-[Horner] I'm gonna go. Get myself sorted.
See you later.
[commentator 2] <i>We're moments away</i>
<i>from the greatest showdown</i>
<i>that this sport has seen.</i>
<i>Hamilton versus Verstappen.</i>
<i>Winner takes it all.</i>
[Horner] You'd prefer an attacking race?
-Yeah.
-[Horner] Yeah.
-If we need to.
-[Horner] If we need to, yeah. Understood.
Just fucking do what you've done
at every single race you've driven for us.
Okay? You'll be fine.
[tense music playing]
[Toto] Lewis has won more than 100 races.
He's beaten all records.
He's a seven-time world champion.
And you can be sure that he's gonna push
in order to win
the eighth World Championship.
[Lewis] Radio check.
[Bono] Radio's loud and clear.
[Horner] Max is driving
with such confidence, aggression.
And after the last seven years of pain,
we've got to do everything we can
to get this over the line.
[Max] Radio check.
[Lambiase] <i>Loud.</i>
[Horner] What Max has done,
from the moment
that he stepped in the car as a teenager,
to suddenly there he is
as a 24-year-old young man,
it's been a hell of a journey.
[commentator 1] <i>All eyes now</i>
<i>focused on the grid.</i>
<i>We've been waiting for this</i>
<i>all season long.</i>
[dramatic music playing]
[Max exhales sharply]
[Max] As a driver, I'm only there to win.
That's the only thing that counts.
[Lewis] It's been the most difficult
year of racing.
I've fought hard
for this World Championship.
We're gonna have a battle.
May the best man win.
[Max] The world champion
against the young gun. A proper battle.
[Lewis exhales sharply]
[engines revving]
{\an8}[commentator 1]
<i>Hamilton gets a decent start.</i>
-[Lewis] What's the situation behind?
<i>-</i>[Bono] <i>Verstappen, position two.</i>
<i>Great stuff, Lewis.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Unbelievable start</i>
<i>from Hamilton!</i>
<i>But we're only on the first lap.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Norris goes wide!</i>
{\an8}[Norris] I messed up.
[Joseph] <i>Car behind is Sainz.</i>
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>Here comes Carlos Sainz</i>
<i>bearing down on Lando Norris.</i>
[Adami] <i>Norris in front of you.</i>
<i>You can push.</i>
[Joseph] <i>Be careful.</i>
<i>Sainz right behind you.</i>
<i>-Lando?</i>
-[Norris] Okay, confirm.
[commentator 2] <i>Sainz to the outside.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>There comes Leclerc.</i>
<i>There's three abreast.</i>
[man 1] Oh my God!
[commentator 3] <i>Carlos Sainz goes through!</i>
[Joseph] <i>That didn't quite go to plan.</i>
[Norris] <i>The Ferraris</i>
<i>got way too close to me.</i>
[man 2] Ah, God.
[Adami] That was good. Currently P4.
[Sainz] <i>Yeah, I think we are good.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Sainz in fourth,</i>
<i>Norris fifth, Leclerc in sixth.</i>
<i>Out in front, Hamilton still has the lead</i>
<i>from Max Verstappen.</i>
[crew members] Come on, Max!
[commentator 2] <i>Verstappen is closing in.</i>
<i>Verstappen takes the lead of the race!</i>
[crew members] Come on!
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton regains the lead,</i>
<i>but he cut the corner.</i>
[Max] He has to give that back.
[Lambiase] Yup, we're on it, Max.
Don't worry.
{\an8}[Lewis] He pushed me off track.
[engineer] Michael,
what would you like us to do?
[Masi] Give up the entire gap.
[commentator 2]
<i>They've penalized Hamilton,</i>
<i>but he gets to keep the lead.</i>
-Fucking hell.
-[man 3] Yes.
Michael, it's Christian.
[Masi] Go ahead, Christian.
He has to give that back.
Your regulations are clear.
[Masi] The stewards view was that
he gave up all of the lasting advantage.
[Horner] Where did he give it up?
My job is to
push as hard as I can for this team.
If I look back over the season,
nothing has gone our way.
-Where did he give it up?
-[Masi] Before the end of the lap.
-We haven't seen--
-[Masi] Immediately.
Okay.
[Max] That is incredible.
What are they doing here?
[Horner] <i>Max, let's just get on with this</i>
<i>and win it on track, mate.</i>
I'm a believer that fate
always balances things out in the end.
[Bono] <i>Great work, Lewis. Keep it up.</i>
Red Bull is a bit like the baby
throwing the toys out of the pram.
We are just focused
on delivering the best possible race.
<i>-</i>[commentator 4]<i> Verstappen behind.</i>
<i>-</i>[commentator 1] <i>1.5 seconds now the gap.</i>
{\an8}[Bottas] Which position I am?
[Riki] <i>Currently P8.</i>
[Bottas] Fuck. Shit!
[Bono] Okay, Lewis, so box, box.
{\an8}[commentator 3] <i>Hamilton and Verstappen</i>
<i>both going for new tires.</i>
{\an8}[Bird] <i>This pace is good, Checo.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>This puts Pérez</i>
<i>in the lead of the Grand Prix.</i>
-[Pérez] What's the plan now?
<i>-</i>[Bird] <i>We'll be looking to hold up Lewis.</i>
[Pérez] Yeah.
[Horner] Sergio,
he's a phenomenal team player.
He's just what we need in this fight.
[Bird] <i>Hamilton, car behind.</i>
[Pérez] I've never had a race car
capable of achieving podiums.
To be fighting Mercedes is tremendous.
[crew members] Come on.
Checo, come on! Come on!
Christian, he just wants me
to maximize the full car potential.
You can imagine how big
this opportunity is for me.
-[Bird] <i>Okay, back him up. Back him up.</i>
-[Pérez] Yeah.
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton gets</i>
<i>a really good drive</i>
<i>and takes the lead</i>
<i>of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</i>
[crew members] Come on! Come on! Come on!
[Horner] Checo, he's a tough operator.
He's like a dog with a bone.
He never gives up.
[commentator 2] <i>Pérez goes to the inside!</i>
<i>Pérez is back in front!</i>
Go on, Checo! Yes, mate!
[commentator 1]
<i>This is really frustrating Lewis Hamilton.</i>
[Lewis] Some dangerous driving.
[Toto] Michael, it's a bit dangerous.
Can you warn them?
[Masi] So far, they're racing, Toto.
Hard racing.
[tense music playing]
[Bird] <i>Brilliant job, Checo.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>Pérez playing</i>
<i>the ultimate team game here.</i>
{\an8}[Lambiase] <i>Okay,</i>
<i>so gap to Hamilton, eight seconds.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Max Verstappen is closing!</i>
Come on!
[Lambiase] <i>Okay, Max, let's go.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Verstappen is right with him now.</i>
[Bono] Verstappen, the car behind now.
[commentator 1] <i>Hamilton needs</i>
<i>to get past Pérez here!</i>
[commentator 2] <i>He gets the job done.</i>
<i>Hamilton leads the Grand Prix.</i>
[cheering]
[commentator 2] <i>But Verstappen</i>
<i>is coming right with him.</i>
Come on!
[Bird] <i>Okay, Checo, good job.</i>
<i>Let Max pass.</i>
[commentator 3]
<i>Pérez let his teammate through.</i>
[suspenseful music playing]
{\an8}[Max] Ah, Checo is a legend.
[Lambiase] Absolute animal.
<i>Okay, Max, focus on Hamilton.</i>
[Bono] <i>So, Verstappen just one second.</i>
[Horner] Come on, let's have a go at it.
[commentator 2]<i> Only eight laps to go.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton is extending</i>
<i>his lead at the front.</i>
<i>What can Verstappen do?</i>
[Lambiase] <i>Okay, Max.</i>
<i>Just get your head down. Let's go.</i>
[Bono] These are great laps, Lewis.
Keep it up. Keep the pressure on.
[commentator 1] <i>The championship trophy</i>
<i>going Hamilton's way as it stands.</i>
[Horner] The clock's ticking.
Max is driving his heart out there,
but, uh, we're gonna need a miracle.
[commentator 3] <i>Lap 52 of 58 now.</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton edging</i>
<i>closer and closer to the title.</i>
{\an8}[Jego] <i>Okay, Nicky. Overtake Schumacher.</i>
<i>Could be your last attempt.</i>
It has to be this lap, mate.
Give everything.
<i>Try to push hard now. Push hard.</i>
[Latifi] Nah. They forced me off the road.
[Jego] <i>Stay with him. Stay with him.</i>
<i>Put him under pressure.</i>
[tires squealing]
[commentator 1] <i>Oh no!</i>
<i>Nicholas Latifi has crashed.</i>
Hang on. We've got…
a big shunt. Big shunt.
[commentator 1] <i>That will be a safety car.</i>
<i>And this completely changes</i>
<i>the context of this race.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>Max,</i>
<i>there's yellow flags at turn 14.</i>
<i>Latifi's completely in the middle</i>
<i>of the road. Debris all over the shop.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Hamilton was just</i>
<i>moments away from winning this.</i>
<i>-What is gonna happen now?</i>
-[Toto yells] No! No!
[helicopter whirring]
[Jego] <i>You okay?</i>
-[Latifi] I lost it.
-[Jego] <i>Okay, Nicky. So you can jump out.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>The safety car is deployed.</i>
[Horner] We've gotta have a go at that.
[Lambiase] Box and pit.
Confirm, please, Max.
[commentator 3] <i>Red Bull pit Verstappen.</i>
<i>There's a risk he'll lose position.</i>
<i>But Red Bull will be gambling</i>
<i>on faster tires.</i>
[Horner] Look, we got nothing to lose.
Winning this championship is gonna be
all about maximizing our chances,
taking opportunities.
We've got half a chance
and we've gotta go for it.
[Lambiase] <i>All right, let's have it.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>Verstappen is quite a way behind Hamilton.</i>
<i>There are five lapped cars</i>
<i>standing between him and the race leader.</i>
[Max] Uh, these need
to get out of the way.
They should unlap themselves.
[Buxton] Ordinarily, under a safety car,
the lapped cars
are allowed to unlap themselves.
So they overtake the safety car
and catch up to the back of the pack.
It allows the actual order
of the Grand Prix,
first, second, third, fourth,
to line up behind the safety car
so that when they go back to racing,
the order is correct.
[Lambiase] <i>Max, lapped cars</i>
<i>will not be allowed to overtake.</i>
[commentator 2] <i>Oh, lapped cars</i>
<i>will not be allowed to overtake.</i>
[commentator 4] <i>Which leaves Verstappen</i>
<i>with a lot of work to do then.</i>
[Max] Yeah, of course. Typical decision.
I'm not surprised.
They may as well give
this fucking championship to Hamilton.
[Lewis] How many cars are in between us?
[Bono] <i>Uh, five cars between you.</i>
[tense music playing]
-Christian to Michael.
-[Masi] <i>Go ahead, Christian.</i>
Why… why… why aren't we getting
these lapped cars out of the way?
[Masi] Because, Christian,
just give me a second.
Okay, my main big one
is to get this, uh, incident clear.
You only need one racing lap.
[Masi] Yeah.
[Lambiase] <i>The Williams is on a crane.</i>
<i>That's being moved out of the way now.</i>
<i>Keep working the tires, Max.</i>
{\an8}[Norris] It's green on the safety car.
{\an8}[Joseph] <i>They want you to overtake</i>
<i>the safety car. Right, let's go.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>All the cars ahead of you</i>
<i>are allowed to overtake Hamilton.</i>
[commentator 2]
<i>Well, this is highly unusual.</i>
<i>Not all of the cars</i>
<i>are allowed to unlap themselves.</i>
{\an8}<i>Just the five</i>
<i>in between Hamilton and Verstappen.</i>
{\an8}[Stroll] There's cars
overtaking the safety car.
{\an8}[Michell] <i>Not… not us. Not us.</i>
<i>Stay where you are. Stay where you are.</i>
{\an8}[Stroll] Man, what the fuck?
{\an8}Only a certain number of cars
were allowed to unlap themselves.
They were the cars between Lewis Hamilton
in first and Max Verstappen in second.
{\an8}[Sainz] Very, very strange.
{\an8}Very unfair.
[Buxton] When you look at
it in simple terms,
Max was the only beneficiary.
[commentator 2] <i>It's a really bizarre one,</i>
<i>and it's harsh on Hamilton.</i>
[Lewis] Shit.
[commentator 2] <i>This is a mess.</i>
<i>Another huge mess.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>Safety car is in this lap, Max.</i>
Come on!
-[man 4] Go on, boy.
-[man 5] Come on, boy!
Fuck!
[Lewis] Fuck, is he right behind me?
With new tires?
[Bono] <i>Verstappen, the car behind now.</i>
[commentator 1] <i>It has left Lewis Hamilton</i>
<i>and Max Verstappen side by side.</i>
[Lewis] I've always had a target
on my back, since I started racing.
It does feel like
people can be out to get you.
Michael, that is so not right.
That is so not right!
[commentator 3] <i>The safety car</i>
<i>coming in on this lap.</i>
Come on, Max!
[crew members yell] Come on! Come on!
[commentator 1] <i>We're gonna have one lap</i>
<i>of racing to decide the championship.</i>
[Lambiase] <i>This is it, mate. This is it.</i>
[tense music continues]
[Bono] <i>So just prepare your tires.</i>
<i>One lap remaining.</i>
Come on!
-[man 6] Come on!
-[man 7] Let's do it!
[commentator 1] <i>And we have got</i>
<i>3.2 miles of racing action</i>
<i>all the way to the checkered flag.</i>
<i>Here we go!</i>
[crew members shout encouragement]
[commentator 1] <i>Is it gonna be</i>
<i>a first World Championship for Verstappen?</i>
-[man 8] Yes, boy!
-[man 9] Come on!
[commentator 1] <i>Is it gonna be an eighth</i>
<i>World Championship for Lewis Hamilton?</i>
Get in!
Come on!
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen takes the lead</i>
<i>of the race!</i>
[raucous cheering]
[Toto] No, Michael! No! No!
[commentator 1] <i>Here comes</i>
<i>Lewis Hamilton though!</i>
<i>Verstappen stays ahead!</i>
Come on!
[Lewis] Nah,
this is getting manipulated, man.
[commentator 1] <i>They have shared</i>
<i>a brilliant championship battle.</i>
<i>But the championship</i>
<i>can only be won by one.</i>
[Max yells gleefully] Yes! Yes! Oh my God!
Yes! Yes!
[Max giggles]
[excited yelling, whooping]
Fucking yes! Yes!
[commentator 1] <i>Max Verstappen,</i>
<i>for the first time ever,</i>
<i>is champion of the world!</i>
[Max] Oh my God! [delighted giggling]
Max Verstappen,
you are the world champion.
The world champion!
Fucking hell!
[Max] That is unbelievable, guys.
[chuckles]
[Horner] We love you.
We absolutely fucking love you.
[triumphant music playing]
[indistinct chattering]
-[Horner] Aww!
-[Pérez chuckles]
[crew members yell triumphantly]
[Horner] Oh! [chuckles]
Oh!
[Horner laughs emotionally]
-We did it. We did it!
-[Geri] I love you. You did it!
-[fireworks exploding]
-[crowd cheering]
[man 10] <i>Well done, gents.</i>
<i>You did everything you could</i>
<i>all year. Well done.</i>
[distant fireworks exploding]
[tense music playing]
[Toto] I didn't even see
Max crossing the line.
But my very reaction in that moment was,
"What just happened?"
Michael and race control.
[Masi] <i>Go ahead, Toto.</i>
You need to reinstate the lap before.
That's not right.
<i>-</i>[Masi] <i>Toto…</i>
-Yes?
<i>-</i>[Masi] <i>It's called a motor race, okay?</i>
<i>-</i>[Toto] Sorry?
[Masi] <i>We went car racing.</i>
-What did he say?
-[man 7] "We went car racing." <i>Autorennen.</i>
[Toto] Max was worthy
of winning the championship.
But not in the way it happened.
[distant cheering]
If you're doing a good enough job,
you will win the race.
And here, that was not how it went.
The decision was simply wrong.
And it's clear
that this is gonna leave some scars
on Lewis, myself, and the team.
[crowd cheering]
[Lewis] We did an amazing job this year.
We gave it everything.
It's been, uh,
the… the most difficult of seasons.
We never gave up,
and that's the most important thing.
I just really wish a big congratulations
to Max and to his team.
-[Max yells]
-[crowd cheering]
[all cheering]
[Horner] Because of the intensity,
because of the struggles
that we've had throughout the year,
because of the seven years
of struggling and perseverance,
it was just the most,
you know, unbelievable feeling.
You're world champion! [laughs gleefully]
You did it! You did it! [laughs]
-[Max yells indistinctly]
-Amazing!
[raucous cheering, whistling]
[inaudible]
[Max] The goal was, together with my dad,
to win a championship.
We had pole positions, race wins,
but this was the ultimate dream.
And now that we have achieved that,
it's something I will never forget.
[Horner] Some big names on there.
-[Max] Yeah.
-You're with all of 'em now.
Lewis had done everything that was
necessary to win the championship.
It was taken away from him
and there's nothing better
that they could have done to motivate us.
[Max] Little present for you.
[Horner] Oh wow.
That's really, really special.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Look at that. Amazing.
-Thank you.
-I mean, after especially this season.
[both chuckle]
[producer] Will Red Bull have
a target on their backs next year?
Everybody has a target
on their backs next year.
